<h2>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />JAN&#8217;S WEDDING.</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Eastward, afar, the coasts of men were seen</p>
<p>Dim, shadowy, and spectral; like a still</p>
<p>Broad land of spirits lay the vacant sea</p>
<p>Beneath the silent heavens&mdash;here and there,</p>
<p>Perchance, a vessel skimmed the watery waste,</p>
<p>Like a white-winged sea-bird, but it moved</p>
<p>Too pale and small beneath the vail of space.</p>
<p>There, too, went forth the sun</p>
<p>Like a white angel, going down to visit</p>
<p>The silent, ice-washed cloisters of the Pole.&#8221;</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>&mdash;Richter&#8217;s &#8220;Titan.&#8221;</span></p>
</div></div>
<p>More than fifty years ago this thing happened:
Jan Vedder was betrothed to
Margaret Fae. It was at the beginning of the
Shetland summer, that short interval of inexpressible
beauty, when the amber sunshine lingers
low in the violet skies from week to week;
and the throstle and the lark sing at midnight,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
and the whole land has an air of enchantment,
mystic, wonderful, and far off.</p>
<p>In the town of Lerwick all was still, though
it was but nine o&#8217;clock; for the men were
at the ling-fishing, and the narrow flagged
street and small quays were quite deserted.
Only at the public fountain there was a little
crowd of women and girls, and they sat around
its broad margin, with their water pitchers and
their knitting, laughing and chatting in the
dreamlike light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, and so Margaret Fae marries at last;
she, too, marries, like the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As every one knows, it is easier to begin
that coil than to end it; and no one has ever
thought that Margaret would marry Jan&mdash;he
that is so often at the dance, and so seldom at
the kirk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and it is said that he is not much of
a man. Magnus Yool can wag him here; and
Nicol Sinclair send him there, and if
Suneva Torr but cast her nixie-eyes on him,
he leaves all to walk by her side. It is little
mind of his own he hath; besides that, he is
hard to deal with, and obstinate.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That is what we all think, Gisla; thou alone
hast uttered it. But we will say no more of
Jan, for oft ill comes of women&#8217;s talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speakers were middle-aged women who
had husbands and sons in the fishing fleet, and
they cast an anxious glance toward it, as they
lifted their water pitchers to their heads, and
walked slowly home together, knitting as they
went. Lerwick had then only one street of
importance, but it was of considerable length,
extending in the form of an amphitheater
along the shore, and having numberless little
lanes or closes, intersected by stairs, running
backward to an eminence above the town. The
houses were generally large and comfortable,
but they were built without the least regard to
order. Some faced the sea, and some the land,
and the gable ends projected on every side,
and at every conceivable angle. Many of their
foundations were drilled out of the rock
upon the shore, and the smooth waters of the
bay were six feet deep at the open doors or
windows.</p>
<p>The utmost quiet reigned there. Shetland
possessed no carts or carriages, and only the
clattering of a shelty&#8217;s gallop, or the song of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
drunken sailor disturbed the echoes. The
whole place had a singular, old-world look, and
the names over the doors carried one back to
Norseland and the Vikings. For in these
houses their children dwelt, still as amphibious
as their forefathers, spending most of their
lives upon the sea, rarely sleeping under a roof,
or warming themselves at a cottage fire; a rugged,
pious, silent race, yet subject, as all Norsemen
are, to fits of passionate and uncontrollable
emotion.</p>
<p>Prominently among the Thorkels and Halcros,
the Yools and Traills, stood out the name
of Peter Fae. Peter had the largest store in
Lerwick, he had the largest fish-curing shed, he
was the largest boat owner. His house of
white stone outside the town was two stories
high, and handsomely furnished; and it was
said that he would be able to leave his daughter
Margaret £10,000; a very large fortune for
a Shetland girl. Peter was a Norseman of pronounced
type, and had the massive face and
loose-limbed strength of his race, its faculty
for money-getting, and its deep religious sentiment.
Perhaps it would be truer to say, its
deep Protestant sentiment, for Norsemen have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
always been Protestants; they hated the Romish
church as soon as they heard of it.</p>
<p>If the Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-American
wishes to see whence came the distinguishing
traits of his race, let him spend a few weeks
among the Shetland Norsemen, for they have
pre-eminently those qualities we are accustomed
to pride ourselves upon possessing&mdash;the
open air freshness of look, the flesh and blood
warmth of grip, the love of the sea, the resolute
earnestness of being and doing, the large,
clear sincerity of men accustomed to look
stern realities in the face.</p>
<p>Peter&#8217;s wife, Thora, was also of pure Norse
lineage, and in many an unrecognized way
her ancestors influenced her daily life. She
had borne four sons, but, in the expressive
form of Shetland speech, &#8220;the sea had got
them;&#8221; and her daughter Margaret was the
sole inheritor of their gathered gold. Thora
was a proud, silent woman, whose strongest
affections were with her children in their lonely
sea graves. In her heart, deeper down than
her faith could reach, lay a conviction that the
Faes and Thorkels who had sailed those seas
for centuries had &#8220;called&#8221; her boys to them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
And she was always nursing an accusation
against herself for a rite which she had observed
for their welfare, but which she was now
sure had been punished by their death. For
often, when they had been tossing on the black
North Sea, she had gone to the top of the hill,
and looking seaward she had raised from the
past the brown-sailed ships, and the big yellow-haired
men tugging at their oars; and in
her heart there had been a supplication to their
memory, which Peter, had he known it, would
have denounced, with the sternest wrath, as
neither more nor less than a service to Satan.</p>
<p>But what do we know of the heart nearest to
our own? What do we know of our own
heart? Some ancestor who sailed with Offa,
or who fought with the Ironsides, or protested
with the Covenanters, or legislated with the
Puritans, may, at this very hour, be influencing
us, in a way of which we never speak, and in
which no other soul intermeddles.</p>
<p>Thora had one comfort. Her daughter was
of a spirit akin to her own. Peter had sent
her to Edinburgh, hoping that she would bring
back to his northern home some of those lowland
refinements of which he had a shadowy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
and perhaps exaggerated idea. But Margaret
Fae&#8217;s character was not of that semi-fluid
nature which can easily be run into new
molds. She had looked with distrust and
dislike upon a life which seemed to her artificial
and extravagant, and had come back to
Shetland with every Norse element in her
character strengthened and confirmed.</p>
<p>What then made her betroth herself to Jan
Vedder? A weak, wasteful man, who had
little but his good-natured, pleasant ways and
his great beauty to recommend him. And yet
the wise and careful Margaret Fae loved him;
loved him spontaneously, as the brook loves to
run, and the bird loves to sing.</p>
<p>&#8220;But bear in mind, husband,&#8221; said Thora, on
the night of the betrothal, &#8220;that this thing is
of thy own doing. Thou hired Jan Vedder,
when thou couldst well have hired a better
man. Thou brought him to thy house. Well,
then, was there any wonder that ill-luck should
follow the foolish deed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wife, the lad is a pleasant lad. If he had
money to even Margaret&#8217;s tocher, and if he
were more punctual at the ordinances, there
would be no fault to him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></div>
<p>&#8220;So I think, too. But when a man has not
religion, and has beside empty pockets, then
he is poor for both worlds. It seems, then,
that our Margaret must marry with a poor
man. And let me tell thee, it was a little thing
moved thee, for because Jan had a handsome
face, and a bright smile, thou liked him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many a sore heart folks get who set liking
before judgment. But if there is good in the
lad, then to get married will bring it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is as it may be. Often I have seen it
bring out ill. Can any one tell if a man be
good or ill, unless they dwell under the same
roof with him? Abroad, who is so pleasant as
Ragon Torr? But at home, every body there
has to look to his wishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point in the conversation, Margaret
entered. She was a tall, straight girl, with a
finely-featured, tranquil face, admirably framed
in heavy coils of hair that were yellow as dawn.
Her complexion was exquisite, and her eyes
blue, and cool, and calm. She was still and
passionless in manner, but far from being cold
at heart; nevertheless, her soul, with the
purity of crystal, had something also of its
sharp angles; something which might perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
become hard and cutting. She carried herself
loftily, and walked with an air of decision.
Peter looked at her steadily and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, thou hast done ill, Margaret. When
a young girl marries, she must face life for herself;
and many are the shoulders that ask for
burdens they can not bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed! And it is all little to my mind,&#8221;
added the mother. &#8220;I had spoken to thee for
thy cousin Magnus Hay; and then here comes
this Jan Vedder!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he comes!&#8221; and Margaret stood
listening, the pink color on her cheeks spreading
to the tips of her ears, and down her white
throat. &#8220;Yes, he comes!&#8221; and with the words,
Jan stood in the open door. A bright, handsome
fellow he was! There was no one in all
the Islands that was half so beautiful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter,&#8221; he cried joyfully, &#8220;here has happened
great news! The &#8216;Sure-Giver&#8217; is in the
harbor with all her cargo safe. She came
in with the tide. All her planks and nails are
lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is great news, surely, Jan. But it is
ill luck to talk of good luck. Supper is ready
sit down with us.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>But Thora spoke no word, and Jan looked at
Margaret with the question in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means this, and no more, Jan. I have
told my father and mother that thou would
make me thy wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I desire, most of all things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there is little need of long talk. I
betroth myself to thee here for life or death, Jan
Vedder; and my father and my mother they
are the witnesses;&#8221; and as she spoke, she went
to Jan, and put her hands in his, and Jan drew
her proudly to his breast and kissed her.</p>
<p>Thora left the room without a glance at the
lovers. Peter stood up, and said angrily:
&#8220;Enough, and more than enough has been said
this night. No, Jan; I will not put my palm
against thine till we have spoken together.
There is more to a marriage than a girl&#8217;s &#8216;Yes&#8217;,
and a wedding ring.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the manner of Jan&#8217;s betrothal; and
as he walked rapidly back into the town, there
came a feeling into his heart of not being quite
pleased with it. In spite of Margaret&#8217;s affection
and straightforward decision, he felt
humiliated.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is what a man gets who wooes a rich wife,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
he muttered; &#8220;but I will go and tell Michael
Snorro about <ins title='Added quote'>it.&#8221;</ins> And he smiled at the prospect,
and hurried onward to Peter&#8217;s store.</p>
<p>For Michael Snorro lived there. The opening
to the street was closed; but the one
facing the sea was wide open; and just within
it, among the bags of feathers and swans&#8217; down,
the piles of seal skins, the barrels of whale oil,
and of sea-birds&#8217; eggs, and the casks of smoked
geese, Michael was sitting. The sea washed
the warehouse walls, and gurgled under the
little pier, that extended from the door, but it
was the only sound there was. Michael, with
his head in his hands, sat gazing into the
offing where many ships lay at anchor. At the
sound of Jan&#8217;s voice his soul sprang into his
face for a moment, and he rose, trembling with
pleasure, to meet him.</p>
<p>In all his desolate life, no one had loved
Michael Snorro. A suspicion that &#8220;he was
not all there,&#8221; and therefore &#8220;one of God&#8217;s
bairns,&#8221; had insured him, during his long orphanage,
the food, and clothes, and shelter, necessary
for life; but no one had given him love.
And Michael humbly acknowledged that he
could not expect it, for nature had been cruelly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
unkind to him. He was, indeed, of almost gigantic
size, but awkward and ill-proportioned.
His face, large and flat, had the whiteness of
clay, except at those rare intervals when his
soul shone through it; and no mortal, but Jan
Vedder, had ever seen that illumination.</p>
<p>It would be as hard to tell why Michael
loved Jan as to say why Jonathan&#8217;s soul clave
to David as soon as he saw him. Perhaps it
was an unreasonable affection, but it was one
passing the love of woman, and, after all, can
we guess how the two men may have been
spiritually related? There was some tie of
which flesh and blood knew not between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael, I am going to be married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jan&mdash;and what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be with me as others; I shall have
children, and grow rich, and old, and die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it, Jan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret Fae.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that. Well, thou art sunshine,
Jan, and she is like a pool of clear water. If
the sun shines not, then the water will freeze,
and grow cold and hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou dost not like women, Michael.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, but I trust them not. Where the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
devil can not go, he sends a woman. Well,
then, he will find no such messenger for me.
He must come himself. That is well; the fight
will be easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I am married I shall sail my own
boat, and thou shalt be always with me, Michael.
We will feel the fresh wind blowing in the canvas,
and the salt spindrift in our faces, and the
boat going as if she were a solan flying for the
rock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that thy thought, then? Let me tell
thee that thou art counting thy fish while they
are swimming. Until Peter Fae&#8217;s hands are
full of earth, he will not part with one gold
piece. Make up thy mind to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret will have her tocher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be seen; but if thou wants money,
Jan, there it is in my chest, and what greater
joy can I have than to see it in thy hand&mdash;all
of it? It would be thy grace to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Jan rose up and laid his arm across
Michael&#8217;s shoulder; and Michael&#8217;s lifted face
caught the glow of Jan&#8217;s bending one and the
men&#8217;s souls spoke to each other, though their
lips never parted.</p>
<p>The next day proved Michael right. Peter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
did not name Margaret&#8217;s tocher. He said he
would give Margaret a house with all needful
plenishing; and he promised also to pay all
the wedding expenses. But there was no word
of any sum of ready money; and Jan was too
proud in his poverty to ask for his right. He
did, indeed, suggest that when he was a house-holder
he should have more wages. But Peter
would not see the justice of any such addition.
&#8220;I give thee all thou art worth, and I will not
give thee a Scotch merk more,&#8221; he answered
roughly. &#8220;When it comes to a question of
wage, Jan, the son and the stranger are the
same to me.&#8221; And when Jan told his friend
what had been promised, Michael said only:
&#8220;Well, then, thou wilt have the woman also.&#8221;</p>
<p>The twelfth of August is &#8220;the fisherman&#8217;s
foy&#8221; in Shetland, and the great feast of
the Islands. It was agreed, therefore, that the
marriage should take place at that time. For
there would be at least two hundred fishing
vessels in Brassy Sound at that time, and with
most of the fishermen Peter either had had
business, or might have in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;For three days we will keep the feast for
all who choose to come,&#8221; he said; and so, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
the procession formed for the church, nearly six
hundred men and women were waiting to follow
Jan and his bride. Then Jan led her to the
front of it, and there was a murmur of wonder
and delight. Her dress was of the richest white
satin, and her heavy golden ornaments&mdash;the heirlooms
of centuries&mdash;gave a kind of barbaric
splendor to it. The bright sunlight fell all over
her, and added to the effect; and Jan, with
a bridegroom&#8217;s pardonable pride, thought she
looked more than mortal.</p>
<p>Going to the church, the procession preserved
the gravity of a religious rite; but on the return,
some one touched lightly the strings of a
violin, and, in a moment, hundreds of voices
were chanting:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is often that I have said it: In the night
thou art my dream, and my waking thought in
the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved thee always; not for three months,
not for a year, but I loved thee from the first, and
my love shall not wither, until death part us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my beloved! My wife! Dearer to
me than the light of the day! Closer to me
than my hands and feet! Nothing but death
shall part thee and me, forever!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>The singing opened their hearts; then came
the feast and the dance, that endless active
dance which is the kind of riot in which grave
races give vent to the suppressed excitement of
their lives. It did not please Margaret; she was
soon weary of the noise and commotion, and
heartily glad when, on the eve of the third
day, she was called upon to give the parting
toast:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s to the men who cast the net, and
the long line,&#8221; she cried, lifting the silver cup
above her head. &#8220;And may He hold His hand
about them all, and open the mouth of the
gray fish!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And here&#8217;s to the bride,&#8221; answered the
oldest fisher present, &#8220;and may God give her a
blessing in both hands!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they separated, and some went to their
homes in Lerwick and Scalloway, and others
sailed to Ireland and Scotland, and even Holland;
but Peter knew that however much the
feast had cost him, it was money put out at
good interest, and that he would be very
likely to find it again at the next fishing season.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />A LITTLE CLOUD IN THE SKY.</h2>

<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;All the flowers of Love and Happiness blow double.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>As it happened that year the peerie, or
Indian summer, was of unusual length
and beauty. The fine weather lingered until
the end of October. These weeks were full of
joy to Margaret and to Jan, and in them Jan
showed himself in many a charming light. He
played well upon the violin, and as long as
love was his theme Margaret understood him.
He recited to her stirring stories from the
Sagas, and she thought only how handsome
he looked with his flashing eyes, and flushing
face. She never reflected, that the soul which
could put life into these old tales was very
likely to be a soul akin to the restless adventurous
men of which they told. Her home
and her love were sufficient for her happiness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
and she expected that Jan would measure his
desires by the same rule.</p>
<p>But in a few weeks Jan began to weary a
little of a life all love-making. Many things,
laid aside for a time, renewed their influence
over him. He wished to let the romance and
exaggeration of his married position sink into
that better tenderness which is the repose of
passion, and which springs from the depths of
a man&#8217;s best nature. But Margaret was not
capable of renunciation, and Jan got to be
continually afraid of wounding her sensibilities
by forgetting some outward token of
affection. He tried to talk to her of his projects,
of his desire to go to sea again, of his
weariness of the store. She could understand
none of these things. Why should he want to
leave her? Had he ceased to love her? Her
father was happy in the store. It offended her
to hear a word against it. Yet she thought
she loved Jan perfectly, and would have deeply
resented Michael Snorro&#8217;s private verdict
against her&mdash;that she was a selfish woman.</p>
<p>One morning, as the first snow was beginning
to fall, a big Dutch skipper in his loose tunic
and high cap, and wooden clogs, came stalking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
into Peter&#8217;s store, and said, &#8220;Well, here at
last comes &#8216;The North Star.&#8217; Many of us
thought she would come no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan was packing eggs, but he signed to
Michael to take his place, and in a few minutes
he was among the crowd watching her arrival.
She came hurrying in, with all her sails set, as
if she were fleeing from the northern winter
behind her. Her stout sides were torn by
berg and floe, her decks covered with seal
skins and jawbones of whales, and amidships
there was a young polar bear growling in a
huge cask. Her crew, weather-beaten and
covered with snow and frost, had the strange
look of men from lands unknown and far off.
Jan had once sailed in her, and her first mate
was his friend. It was like meeting one from
the dead. Proudly and gladly he took him to
his home. He wanted him to see his beautiful
wife. He was sure Margaret would be
delighted to welcome a man so brave, and so
dear to him.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it was a deep offense to her.
Christian Groat, in his sheepskin suit, oily and
storm-stained, unkempt and unshorn, seemed
strangely out of place in her spotless room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
That he had fought with the elements, and
with the monsters of the deep, made him no
hero in her eyes. She was not thrilled by his
adventures upon drifting floes, and among ice
mountains reeling together in perilous madness.
The story made Jan&#8217;s blood boil, and brought
the glistening tears into his big blue eyes; but
Margaret&#8217;s pulses beat no whit quicker. Christian
Groat was only a vulgar whaler to her, and
that Jan should bring him to her hearth and
table made her angry.</p>
<p>Jan was hurt and humiliated. The visit from
which he had hoped so much, was a pain and a
failure. He walked back into the town with
his friend, and was scarcely able to speak.
Margaret also was silent and grieved. She
thought Jan had wronged her. She had to
make a clean cushion for the chair in which the
man had sat. She persisted for days in smelling
whale oil above the reek of the peat, above even
the salt keenness of the winter air. Her father
had never done such a thing; she could not
understand Jan&#8217;s thoughtlessness about her.</p>
<p>For two days she was silent, and Jan bore it
very well, for he, too, was hurt and angry. On
the third he spoke to his wife, and little by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
little the coolness wore away. But an active
quarrel and some hard words had perhaps been
better, for then there might have followed
some gracious tears, and a loving reconciliation.
As it was, the evenings wore silently and gloomily
away. Margaret sat, mechanically knitting,
her beautiful face wearing an expression of
injury and resignation that was intolerably
annoying to a man of Jan&#8217;s temper. But though
she said nothing to her husband during these
unhappy hours, the devil talked very plainly in
her place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he asked Jan, &#8220;do you stay beside
a sulky woman, when there are all your old
companions at Ragon Torr&#8217;s? There, also,
is the song and the tale, and the glass of good
fellowship. And who would be so heartily
welcome as Jan Vedder?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan knew all this well. But as he did not
care to make his wife unhappy, he determined
to deceive her. It was snowing, and likely to
snow; Margaret would not come down to the
store in such weather. So he said to her,
&#8220;Michael Snorro hath a fever. He can not
work. That is a bad business, for it is only I
that can fill his place. The work will keep me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
late, wait not for me.&#8221; To himself he said:
&#8220;To leave her alone a few nights, that will be
a good thing; when I stay next at my own
hearth, she may have something to say to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret&#8217;s nature was absolutely truthful.
She never doubted Jan&#8217;s words. In that love
of self which was a miserable omnipresence with
her, she was angry with Snorro for being sick
and thus interfering in her domestic life, but
she fully believed her husband&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>Jan spent two evenings at Ragon Torr&#8217;s, but
on the third morning his conscience smote him
a little. He looked at Margaret, and wished
she would ask, &#8220;Wilt thou come home early
to-night?&#8221; He would gladly have answered
her, &#8220;I will come at whatever hour thou
desirest.&#8221; But, unfortunately, Margaret was at
that moment counting her eggs, and there were
at least two missing. She was a woman who
delighted in small economies; she felt that she
was either being wronged by her servant, or
that her fowls were laying in strange nests.
At that moment it was a subject of great
importance to her; and she never noticed the
eager, longing look in Jan&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>When he said at last. &#8220;Good-by to thee, Margaret;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
she looked up from her basket of eggs
half reproachfully at him. She felt that Jan
might have taken more interest in her loss. She
had not yet divined that these small savings of
hers were a source of anger and heart-burning to
him. He knew well that the price of her endless
knitting, her gathered eggs, wool, and
swans&#8217; down, all went to her private account in
Lerwick Bank. For she had been saving
money since she was a child six years old, and
neither father, mother, nor husband knew how
much she had saved. That was a thing Margaret
kept absolutely to herself and the little
brown book which was in her locked drawer.
There had been times when Jan could have
opened it had he desired; but he had been too
hurt and too proud to do so. If his wife could
not voluntarily trust him, he would not solicit
her confidence. And it had never struck Margaret
that the little book was a hidden rock,
on which every thing might yet be wrecked. It
was there, though the tide of daily life flowed
over it, and though it was never spoken of.</p>
<p>All that day Jan was sulky and obstinate,
and Peter came near quarreling with him more
than once. But Peter thought he knew what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
was the matter, and he smiled grimly to himself
as he remembered Margaret&#8217;s power of
resistance. Perhaps a fellow-feeling made him
unusually patient, for he remembered that
Thora had not been brought to a state of
perfect obedience until she had given him
many a day of active discomfort. He watched
Jan curiously and not without sympathy, for
the training of wives is a subject of interest
even to those who feel themselves to have been
quite successful.</p>
<p>During the first hours of the day Jan was
uncertain what to do. A trifle would have
turned him either way, and in the afternoon
the trifle came. A boat arrived from Kirkwall,
and two of her crew were far-off cousins. The
men were in almost as bad condition as Christian
Groat. He would not risk soiling Margaret&#8217;s
chair-cushions again, so he invited them
to meet him at Ragon Torr&#8217;s. As it happened
Margaret had an unhappy day; many little
things went wrong with her. She longed for
sympathy, and began to wish that Jan would
come home; indeed she was half inclined to
go to the store, and ask him if he could
not.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>She opened the door and looked out. It
was still snowing a little, as it had been for a
month. But snow does not lie in Shetland,
and the winters, though dreary and moist, are
not too cold for the daisy to bloom every where
at Christmas, and for the rye grass to have
eight or ten inches of green blade. There was
a young moon, too, and the Aurora, in a phalanx
of rosy spears, was charging upward to
the zenith. It was not at all an unpleasant
night, and, with her cloak and hood of blue
flannel, a walk to the store would be easy and
invigorating.</p>
<p>As she stood undecided and unhappy, she
saw a man approaching the house. She could
not fail to recognize the large, shambling
figure. It was Michael Snorro. A blow from
his mighty hand could hardly have stunned her
more. She shut the door, and sat down sick
at heart. For it was evident that Snorro was
not ill, and that Jan had deceived her. Snorro,
too, seemed to hesitate and waver in his intentions.
He walked past the house several times,
and then he went to the kitchen door.</p>
<p>In a few minutes Elga Skade, Margaret&#8217;s
servant, said to her, &#8220;Here has come Michael
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
Snorro, and he would speak with thy husband.&#8221;
Margaret rose, and went to him. He
stood before the glowing peats, on the kitchen
hearth, seeming, in the dim light, to tower to
the very roof. Margaret looked up with a feeling
akin to terror at the large white face in the
gloom above her, and asked faintly, &#8220;What
is&#8217;t thou wants, Snorro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would speak with Jan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not come yet to his home. At what
hour did he leave the store?&#8221;</p>
<p>At once Snorro&#8217;s suspicions were aroused.
He stood silent a minute, then he said, &#8220;He
may have gone round by thy father&#8217;s. I will
wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man frightened her. She divined that
he distrusted and disapproved of her; and she
could ask nothing more. She left him with
Elga, but in half an hour she became too restless
to bear the suspense, and returned to the
kitchen. Snorro gave her no opportunity to
question him. He said at once, &#8220;It is few
houses in Shetland a man can enter, and no one
say to him, &#8216;Wilt thou eat or drink?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot, Snorro. I am troubled about Jan.
What wilt thou have?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What thou hast ready, and Elga will get it
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few minutes later he sat down to eat with
a calm deliberation which Margaret could not
endure. She put on her cloak and hood, and
calling Elga, said, &#8220;If he asks for me, say that
I spoke of my father&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she slipped out of the front door, and
went with fleet steps into the town. The
street, which was so narrow that it was possible
to shake hands across it, was dark and empty.
The shops were all shut, and the living rooms
looked mostly into the closes, or out to the
sea. Only here and there a lighted square of
glass made her shrink into the shadow of the
gables. But she made her way without hindrance
to a house near the main quay. It was
well lighted, and there was the sound and stir
of music and singing, of noisy conversation and
laughter within it.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was Ragon Torr&#8217;s inn. The front
windows were uncurtained, and she saw, as she
hurriedly passed them, that the main room was
full of company; but she did not pause until
within the close at the side of the house, when,
standing in the shadow of the outbuilt chimney,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
she peered cautiously through the few small
squares on that side. It was as she suspected.
Jan sat in the very center of the company, his
handsome face all aglow with smiles, his hands
busily tuning the violin he held. Torr and half
a dozen sailors bent toward him with admiring
looks, and Ragon&#8217;s wife Barbara, going to and
fro in her household duties, stopped to say
something to him, at which every body laughed,
but Jan&#8217;s face darkened.</p>
<p>Margaret did not hear her name, but she felt
sure the remark had been about herself, and her
heart burned with anger. She was turning
away, when there was a cry of pleasure, and
Suneva Torr entered. Margaret had always
disliked Suneva; she felt now that she hated
and feared her. Her luring eyes were dancing
with pleasure, her yellow hair fell in long, loose
waves around her, and she went to Jan&#8217;s side,
put her hand on his shoulder, and said something
to him.</p>
<p>Jan looked back, and up to her, and nodded
brightly to her request. Then out sprang the
tingling notes from the strings, and clear, and
shrill, and musical, Suneva&#8217;s voice picked them
up with a charming distinctness:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, since we are welcome to Yool,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Up with it, Lightfoot, link it awa&#8217;, boys;</p>
<p>Send for a fiddler, play up the Foula reel,</p>
<p class='indent2'>And we&#8217;ll skip it as light as a maw, boys.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Then she glanced at the men, and her father
and mother, and far in the still night rang out
the stirring chorus:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;The Shaalds of Foula will pay for it a&#8217;!</p>
<p>Up with it, Lightfoot, and link it awa&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Then the merry riot ceased, and Suneva&#8217;s
voice again took up the song&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Now for a light and a pot of good beer,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Up with it, Lightfoot, and link it awa&#8217;, boys!</p>

<p class='indent2'>And the Shaalds of Foula will pay for it a&#8217;, boys.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='smcap'>Chorus</span>:</p>

<p>Up with it, Lightfoot, and link it awa&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Margaret could bear it no longer, and, white
and stern, she turned away from the window.
Then she saw Michael Snorro standing beside
her. Even in the darkness she knew that his
eyes were scintillating with anger. He took
her by the arm and led her to the end of the
close. Then he <ins title='Assuming unclear colon'>said:</ins></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Much of a woman art thou! If I was Jan
Vedder, never again would I see thy face! No,
never!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan lied to me! To me, his wife! Did thou
think he was at my father&#8217;s? He is in Ragon
Torr&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou lied to me also; and if Jan is in
<ins title='Was Ragou'>Ragon</ins> Torr&#8217;s, let me tell thee, that thou sent
him there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I lied not to thee. I lie to no one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yea, but thou told Elga to lie for thee. A
jealous wife knows not what she does. Did
thou go to thy father&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak thou no more to me, Michael Snorro.&#8221;
Then she sped up the street, holding her breast
tightly with both hands, as if to hold back the
sobs that were choking her, until she reached
her own room, and locked fast her door. She
sobbed for hours with all the passionate abandon
which is the readiest relief of great sorrows
that come in youth. In age we know better;
we bow the head and submit.</p>
<p>When she had quite exhausted herself, she
began to long for some comforter, some one to
whom she could tell her trouble. But Margaret
had few acquaintances; none, among the few, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
whom she could make a confidant. From her
father and mother, above all others, she would
keep this humiliation. God she had never
thought of as a friend. He was her Creator,
her Redeemer, also, if it were his good pleasure
to save her from eternal death. He was
the Governor of the Universe; but she knew
him not as a Father pitying his children, as a
God tender to a broken heart. Was it possible
that a woman&#8217;s sharp cry of wounded love
could touch the Eternal? She never dreamed
of such a thing. At length, weary with weeping
and with her own restlessness, she sat down
before the red peats upon the hearth, for once,
in her sorrowful preoccupation, forgetting her
knitting.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Snorro had entered Torr&#8217;s,
and asked for Jan. He would take no excuse,
and no promises, and his white, stern face, and
silent way of sitting apart, with his head in his
hands, was soon felt to be a very uncomfortable
influence. Jan rose moodily, and went away
with him; too cross, until they reached the
store, to ask, &#8220;Why did thou come and spoil
my pleasure, Snorro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neil Bork sails for Vool at the midnight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
tide. Thou told me thou must send a letter by
him to thy cousin Magnus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so. Since Peter will do nothing, I
must seek help of Magnus. Well, then, I will
write the letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it was finished, Jan said, &#8220;Snorro, who
told thee I was at Torr&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wert not at home. I went there, first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then thou hast made trouble for me, be
sure of that. My wife thought that thou wast
ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a bad wife a man must lie to. But, oh,
Jan! Jan! To think that for any woman thou
would tell the lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Jan, being in that garrulous mood which
often precedes intoxication, would have opened
his whole heart to Michael about his domestic
troubles; but Michael would not listen to
him. &#8220;Shut thy mouth tight on that subject,&#8221;
he said angrily. &#8220;I will hear neither
good nor bad of Margaret Vedder. Now, then,
I will walk home with thee, and then I will see
Neil Bork, and give him thy letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret heard their steps at the gate. Her
face grew white and cold as ice, and her heart
hardened at the sound of Snorro&#8217;s voice. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
had always despised him; now, for his interference
with her, she hated him. She could not
tolerate Jan&#8217;s attachment to a creature so rude
and simple. It was almost an insult to herself;
and yet so truthfully did she judge his heart,
that she was quite certain Michael Snorro would
never tell Jan that she had watched him
through Ragon Torr&#8217;s window. She blushed a
moment at the memory of so mean an action,
but instantly and angrily defended it to her own
heart.</p>
<p>Jan came in, with the foolish, good-natured
smile of alcoholic excitement. But when he
saw Margaret&#8217;s white, hard face, he instantly
became sulky and silent. &#8220;Where hast thou
been, Jan?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;It is near the midnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been about my own business. I had
some words to send by Neil Bork to my cousin
Magnus. Neil sails by the midnight tide.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed scornfully. &#8220;Thy cousin Magnus!
Pray, what shall he do for thee? This is
some new cousin, surely!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, since thy father keeps thy tocher
from me, I must borrow of my own kin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As for that, my father hath been better to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
thee than thou deservest. Why didst thou lie
to me concerning Snorro? He has had no
fever. No, indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man must ask his wife whether he can
speak truth to her, or not. Thou can not bear
it. Very well, then, I must lie to thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, be sure, I will tell the truth to thee,
Jan Vedder. Thou hast been at Ragon Torr&#8217;s,
singing with a light woman, and drinking
with&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With my own kin. I advise thee to say
nothing against them. As for Suneva, there is
no tongue in Lerwick but thine will speak evil
of her&mdash;she is a good girl, and she hath a kind
heart. And now, then, who told thee I was at
Torr&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>He asked the question repeatedly, and
instead of answering it, Margaret began to
justify herself. &#8220;Have I not been to thee a
good wife? Has not thy house been kept
well, and thy meals ever good and ready for
thee? Has any thing, great or little, gone to
waste?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou hast been too good. It had been
better if thou had been less perfect; then I
could have spoken to thee of my great wish,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
and thou would have said, as others say, &#8216;Jan,
it would be a joy to see thee at the main-mast, or
casting the ling-lines, or running into harbor
before the storm, with every sail set, as though
thou had stolen ship and lading.&#8217; Thou would
not want me to chaffer with old women about
geese-feathers and bird-eggs. Speak no more.
I am heavy with sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he could sleep! That was such an
aggravation of his offense. She turned sometimes
and looked at his handsome flushed face,
but otherwise she sat hour after hour silent
and almost motionless, her hands clasped upon
her knee, her heart anticipative of wrong, and
with a perverse industry considering sorrows
that had not as yet even called to her. Alas!
alas! the unhappy can never persuade themselves
that &#8220;sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof.&#8221;</p>

</div></div>
<p>The gravitation of character is naturally
toward its weakest point. Margaret&#8217;s
weakest point was an intense, though unconscious,
selfishness. Jan&#8217;s restless craving for
change and excitement made him dissatisfied
with the daily routine of life, lazy, and often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
unreasonable. His very blessings became
offenses to him. His clean, well-ordered
house, made him fly to the noisy freedom of
Ragon Torr&#8217;s kitchen. Margaret&#8217;s never-ceasing
industry, her calmness, neatness and deliberation,
exasperated him as a red cloth does a
bull.</p>
<p>Suneva Torr had married Paul Glumm, and
Jan often watched her as he sat drinking his
ale in Torr&#8217;s kitchen. At home, it is true, she
tormented Glumm with her contrary, provoking
moods; but then, again, she met him with
smiles and endearments that atoned for every
thing. Jan thought it would be a great relief
if Margaret were only angry sometimes. For
he wearied of her constant serenity, as people
weary of sunshine without cloud or shadow.</p>
<p>And Margaret suffered. No one could doubt
that who watched her face from day to day.
She made no complaint, not even to her
mother. Thora, however, perceived it all.
She had foreseen and foretold the trouble, but
she was too noble a woman to point out the
fulfillment of her prophecy. As she went
about her daily work, she considered, and not
unkindly, the best means for bringing Jan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
back to his wife and home, and his first pride
in them.</p>
<p>She believed that the sea only could do it.
After all, her heart was with the men who
loved it. She felt that Jan was as much out
of place counting eggs, as a red stag would be
if harnessed to a plow. She, at least, understood
the rebellious, unhappy look on his
handsome face. When the ling fishing was
near at hand, she said to Peter: &#8220;There is one
thing that is thy duty, and that is to give Jan
the charge of a boat. He is for the sea, and
it is not well that so good a sailor should go
out of the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no mind to do that. Jan will do
well one day, and he will do as ill as can be
the next. I will not trust a boat with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me that where thou could trust
Margaret, thou might well trust nineteen feet
of keel, and fifty fathom of long lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter answered her not, and Thora kept
silence also. But at the end, when he had
smoked his pipe, and was lifting the Bible for
the evening exercise, he said: &#8220;Thou shalt
have thy way, wife; Jan shall have a boat, but
thou wilt see evil will come of it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thou wert always good, Peter, and in this
thing I am thinking of more than fish. There
is sorrow in Margaret&#8217;s house. A mother can
feel that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, meddle thou not in the matter.
Every man loves in his own way. Whatever
there is between Jan and Margaret is a thing
by itself. But I will speak about the boat in
the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter kept his word, and kept it without
smallness or grudging. He still liked Jan. If
there were trouble between him and Margaret
he regarded it as the natural initiation to
married life. Norse women were all high-spirited
and wished to rule; and he would have
despised Jan if he had suspected him of giving
way to Margaret&#8217;s stubborn self-will. Though
she was his own daughter, he did not wish to
see her setting an example of wifely supremacy.</p>
<p>So he called Jan pleasantly and said, &#8220;I
have saved for thee &#8216;The Fair Margaret.&#8217;
Wilt thou sail her this season, Jan? She is
the best boat I have, as thou well knows.
Fourteen hundred hooks she is to carry, and
thou can hire six men to go with thee.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>It made Peter&#8217;s eyes feel misty to see the
instantaneous change in Jan&#8217;s face. He could
not speak his thanks, but he looked them; and
Peter felt troubled, and said, almost querulously,
&#8220;There, that will do, son Jan; go now, and
hire the men thou wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, I should like Snorro.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter hesitated, but he would not tithe his
kindness, and he frankly answered, &#8220;Well, then,
thou shalt have Snorro&mdash;though it will go hard
with me, wanting him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we will make it go well with thee on
the sea, father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As for that, it will be as God pleases. A
man&#8217;s duty is all my claim on thee. Margaret
will be glad to see thee so happy.&#8221; He
dropped his eyes as he spoke of Margaret.
He would not seem to watch Jan, although he
was conscious of doing so.</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman has many minds, father. Who
knows if a thing will make her happy or
angry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a foolish saying, Jan. A wife must
find her pleasure in the thing that pleases her
husband. But now thou wilt have but little
time; the boat is to be tried, and the hooks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
and lines are to go over, and the crew to hire.
I have left all to thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>This pleased Jan most of all. Only a bird
building its first nest could have been as happy
as he was. When at night he opened the door
of his house, and went in with a gay smile, it
was like a resurrection. The pale rose-color on
Margaret&#8217;s cheek grew vivid and deep when he
took her in his arms, and kissed her in the old
happy way. She smiled involuntarily, and
Jan thought, &#8220;How beautiful she is!&#8221; He
told her all Peter had said and done. He was
full of gratitude and enthusiasm. He did not
notice for a few moments that Margaret was
silent, and chillingly unresponsive. He was
amazed to find that the whole affair displeased
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, then, I have married a common fisherman
after all,&#8221; she said bitterly; &#8220;why, Suneva
Torr&#8217;s husband has a bigger boat than thine.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an unfortunate remark, and touched
Jan on a very raw place. He could not refrain
from answering, &#8220;He hath had better luck
than I. Ragon Torr gave Glumm Suneva&#8217;s
tocher, and he has bought his own boat with
it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why not? Every one knows that Glumm
is a prudent man. He never gets on his feet
for nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan was inexpressibly pained and disappointed.
For a moment a feeling of utter
despair came over him. The boat lay upon
his heart like a wreck. He drank his tea
gloomily, and the delicately-browned fish, the
young mutton, and the hot wheat cakes, all
tasted like ashes in his mouth. Perhaps, then,
Margaret&#8217;s heart smote her, for she began to
talk, and to press upon Jan&#8217;s acceptance the
viands which had somehow lost all their savor
to him. Her conversation was in like case.
She would not speak of the boat, since they
could not agree about it; and no other subject
interested Jan. But, like all perfectly selfish
people, she imagined, as a matter of course,
that whatever interested her was the supreme
interest. In her calm, even voice, she spoke of
the spring house-cleaning, and the growth of
her pansies and tulip bulbs, and did not know
that all the time Jan was thinking of his boat,
heaving on the tide-top, or coming into harbor
so heavy with fish that she would be&mdash;in Shetland
phrase&mdash;<i>lippering</i> with the water.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>But, after all, the week of preparation was a
very happy week to Jan and Snorro; and on
the sixteenth of May they were the foremost
of the sixty boats that sailed out of Lerwick
for the ling ground. There was a great crowd
on the pier to see them off&mdash;mothers, and wives,
and sweethearts; boys, sick and sad with longing
and envy; and old men, with the glamor
of their own past in their faces. Among them
was Suneva, in a bright blue dress, with blue
ribbons fluttering in her yellow hair. She stood
at the pier-head and as they passed poured a
cup of ale into the sea, to forespeak good luck
for the fleet. Jan would have dearly liked to
see his wife&#8217;s handsome face watching him, as
he stood by the main-mast and lifted his cap
to Peter. Margaret was not there.</p>
<p>She really felt very much humiliated in Jan&#8217;s
position. She had always held herself a little
apart from the Lerwick women. She had been
to Edinburgh, she had been educated far above
them, and she was quite aware that she would
have a very large fortune. Her hope had been
to see Jan take his place among the merchants
and bailies of Lerwick. She had dreams of the
fine mansion that they would build, and of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
fine furniture which would come from Edinburgh
for it. Margaret was one of those women
to whom a house can become a kingdom, and
its careful ordering an affair of more importance
than the administration of a great nation.
When she chose Jan, and raised him from his
humble position, she had no idea that he would
drift back again to the fishing nets.</p>
<p>For the first time she carried her complaint
home. But Thora in this matter had not
much sympathy with her. &#8220;The sea is his
mother,&#8221; she said; &#8220;he loved her before he loved
thee; when she calls him, he will always go back
to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No man in Shetland hath a better business
to his hand; and how can he like to live in a
boat, he, that hath a home so quiet, and clean,
and comfortable?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thora sighed. &#8220;Thou wilt not understand
then, that what the cradle rocks the spade buries.
The sea spoke to Jan before he lay on his
mother&#8217;s breast. His father hath a grave in it.
Neither gold nor the love of woman will ever
keep them far apart; make up thy mind to
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this might be true, but yet it humiliated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
Margaret. Besides, she imagined that every
wife in Lerwick was saying, &#8220;Not much hold
has Margaret Vedder on her husband. He is
off to sea again, and that with the first boat
that sails.&#8221; Yet if success could have reconciled
her, Jan&#8217;s was wonderful. Not unfrequently
&#8220;The Fair Margaret&#8221; took twenty score ling at
a haul, and every one was talking of her good
luck.</p>
<p>During these days Jan and Snorro drew very
close to each other. When the baits were set
most of the men went to sleep for three hours;
but Snorro always watched, and very often
Jan sat with him. And oh, the grand solemnity
and serenity of these summer nights, when
through belts of calm the boats drifted and the
islands in a charmed circle filled the pale purple
horizon before them. Most fair then was the
treeless land, and very far off seemed the sin
and sorrow of life. The men lay upon the
deck, with a pile of nets or their folded arms
for a pillow, and surely under such a sky, like
Jacob of old, they dreamed of angels.</p>
<p>Snorro and Jan, sitting in the soft, mystical
light, talked together, dropping their voices
involuntarily, and speaking slowly, with thoughtful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
pauses between the sentences. When they
were not talking, Snorro read, and the book
was ever the same, the book of the Four Gospels.
Jan often watched him when he thought
Jan asleep. In that enchanted midnight glow,
which was often a blending of four lights&mdash;moonlight
and twilight, the aurora and the
dawning&mdash;the gigantic figure and white face,
bending over the little book, had a weird and
almost supernatural interest. Then this man,
poor, ugly, and despised, had an incomparable
nobility, and he fascinated Jan.</p>
<p>One night he said to him, &#8220;Art thou never
weary of reading that same book, Snorro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I then ever weary of thee, my Jan?
And these are the words of One who was the
first who loved me. Accordingly, how well I
know his voice.&#8221; Then, in a fervor of adoring
affection, he talked to Jan of his dear Lord
Christ, &#8220;who had stretched out his arms upon
the cross that he might embrace the world.&#8221;
And as he talked the men, one by one, raised
themselves on their elbows and listened; and
the theme transfigured Snorro, and he stood
erect with uplifted face, and looked, in spite of
his fisher&#8217;s suit, so royal that Jan felt humbled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
in his presence. And when he had told, in his
own simple, grand way, the story of him who
had often toiled at midnight with the fishers
on the Galilean sea, as they toiled upon the
Shetland waters, there was a great silence,
until Jan said, in a voice that seemed almost
strange to them: &#8220;Well, then, mates, now we
will look to the lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>All summer, and until the middle of October,
Jan continued at sea; and all summer, whether
fishing for ling, cod, or herring, &#8220;The Fair Margaret&#8221;
had exceptionally good fortune. There
were many other fishers who woke, and watched,
and toiled in their fishing, who did not have
half her &#8220;takes.&#8221; &#8220;It is all Jan&#8217;s luck,&#8221; said
Glumm, &#8220;for it is well known that he flings
his nets and goes to sleep while they fill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, &#8216;it is the net of the sleeping
fisherman takes:&#8217; that is the wise saying of
old times&#8221;&mdash;and though Snorro did not think
of it, the Shetland proverb was but the Norse
form of the Hebrew faith: &#8220;He giveth his
beloved in their sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, in spite of his success, Jan was not
happy. A married man&#8217;s happiness is in the
hands of his wife, and Margaret felt too injured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
to be generous. She was not happy, and she
thought it only just that Jan should be made
to feel it. He had disappointed all her hopes
and aspirations; she was not magnanimous
enough to rejoice in the success of his labors
and aims. Besides, his situation as the hired
skipper of a boat was contemptible in her eyes;
her servant was engaged to a man in the same
position. Another aggravating circumstance
was that her old schoolmate, the minister&#8217;s
niece (a girl who had not a penny piece to her
fortune) was going to marry a rich merchant
from Kirkwall. How she would exult over
&#8220;Margaret Vedder who had married a common
fisherman.&#8221; The exultation was entirely imaginary,
but perhaps it hurt as much as if it had
been actually made.</p>
<p>Success, too, had made Jan more independent:
or perhaps he had grown indifferent to Margaret&#8217;s
anger, since he found it impossible to
please her. At any rate, he asked his friends
to his house without fear or apology. They left
their footmarks on her floors, and their fingermarks
upon her walls and cushions, and Jan only
laughed and said, &#8220;There was, as every one
knew, plenty of water in Shetland to make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
them clean again.&#8221; Numberless other little
things grieved and offended her, so little that,
taken separately, they might have raised a
smile, but in the aggregate they attained the
magnitude of real wrongs.</p>
<p>But, happy or miserable, time goes on, and
about the middle of October even the herring
fishing is over. Peter was beginning to count
up his expenses and his gains. Jan and Snorro
were saying to one another, &#8220;In two days we
must go back to the store.&#8221; That is, they
were trying to say it, but the air was so full of
shrieks that no human voice could be heard.
For all around the boat the sea was boiling
with herring fry, and over them hung tens of
thousands of gulls and terns. Marmots and
guillemots were packed in great black masses
on the white foam, and only a mad human mob
of screaming women and children could have
made a noise comparable. Even that would
have wanted the piercing metallic ring of the
wild birds&#8217; shriek.</p>
<p>Suddenly Snorro leaped to his feet. &#8220;I see a
storm, Jan. Lower and lash down the mast.
We shall have bare time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan saw that the birds had risen and were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
making for the rocks. In a few minutes down
came the wind from the north-east, and a streak
of white rain flying across the black sea was on
top of &#8220;The Fair Margaret&#8221; before the mast was
well secured. As for the nets, Snorro was <ins title='Was cuting'>cutting</ins>
them loose, and in a few moments the
boat was tearing down before the wind. It
was a wild squall; some of the fishing fleet
went to the bottom with all their crews. &#8220;The
Fair Margaret,&#8221; at much risk of loss, saved
Glumm&#8217;s crew, and then had all she could manage
to raise her mizzen, and with small canvas
edge away to windward for the entrance of
Lerwick bay.</p>
<p>Jan was greatly distressed. &#8220;Hard to bear
is this thing, Snorro,&#8221; he said; &#8220;at the last to
have such bad fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a better ending than might have been.
Think only of that, Jan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Peter will count his lost nets; there is
nothing else he will think of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Between nets and men&#8217;s lives, there is only
one choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter said that also, but he was nevertheless
very angry. The loss took possession of his
mind, and excluded all memory of his gains.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
&#8220;It was just like Jan and Snorro,&#8221; he muttered,
&#8220;to be troubling themselves with other boats.
In a sudden storm, a boat&#8217;s crew should mind
only its own safety.&#8221; These thoughts were in
his heart, though he did not dare to form them
into any clear shape. But just as a drop or
two of ink will diffuse itself through a glass of
pure water and defile the whole, so they poisoned
every feeling of kindness which he had to
Jan.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I tell thee?&#8221; he said to Thora,
bitterly. &#8220;Jan does nothing well but he spoils
it. Here, at the end of the season, for a little
gust of wind, he loses both nets and tackle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did well when he saved life, Peter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every man should mind his own affairs.
Glumm would have done that thing first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Glumm would have been little of a
man. And thou, Peter Fae, would have been
the first to tell Glumm so. Thou art saying
evil, and dost not mean it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak no more. It is little a woman understands.
Her words are always like a contrary
wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter was very sulky for some days, and when
at last he was ready to settle with Jan, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
was a decided quarrel. Jan believed himself to
be unfairly dealt with, and bitter words were
spoken on both sides. In reality, Peter knew
that he had been hard with his son, harder by
far than he had ever intended to be; but in his
heart there had sprung up one of those sudden
and unreasonable dislikes which we have all
experienced, and for which no explanation is
possible. It was not altogether the loss of the
nets&mdash;he did not know what it was&mdash;but the
man he liked, and praised, and was proud of
one week, he could hardly endure to see or
speak to the next.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ends all between thee and me,&#8221; said
Peter, pushing a little pile of gold toward Jan.
It was a third less than Jan expected. He gave
it to Margaret, and bade her &#8220;use it carefully,
as he might be able to make little more until
the next fishing season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But thou wilt work in the store this winter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I will not. I will work for no man
who cheats me of a third of my hire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is of my father thou art speaking, Jan
Vedder; remember that. And Peter Fae&#8217;s
daughter is thy wife, though little thou deservest
her.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is like enough that I am unworthy of
thee; but if I had chosen a wife less excellent
than thou it had perhaps been better for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And for me also.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the beginning of a sad end; for
Jan, though right enough at first, soon put himself
in the wrong, as a man who is idle, and has
a grievance, is almost sure to do. He continually
talked about it. On the contrary, Peter
held his tongue, and in any quarrel the man who
can be silent in the end has the popular sympathy.
Then, in some way or other, Peter Fae
touched nearly every body in Lerwick. He
gave them work, or he bought their produce.
They owed him money, or they expected a
favor from him. However much they sympathized
with Jan, they could not afford to quarrel
with Peter.</p>
<p>Only Michael Snorro was absolutely and
purely true to him; but oh, what truth there
was in Michael! Jan&#8217;s wrongs were his
wrongs; Jan&#8217;s anger was but the reflection of
his own.</p>
<p>He watched over him, he sympathized with
him, he loved him entirely, with a love &#8220;wonderful,
passing the love of woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost utterly from home and me,</p>
<p>Lonely, regretful and remote.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Jan now began to hang all day about Ragon
Torr&#8217;s, and to make friends with men as purposeless
as himself. He drank more and more,
and was the leader in all the dances and merry-makings
with which Shetlanders beguile their
long winter. He was very soon deep in Torr&#8217;s
debt, and this circumstance carried him the
next step forward on an evil road.</p>
<p>One night Torr introduced him to Hol Skager,
a Dutch skipper, whose real cargo was a
contraband one of tea, brandy, tobacco and
French goods. Jan was in the very mood to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
join him, and Skager was glad enough of Jan.
Very soon he began to be away from home for
three and four weeks at a time. Peter and
Margaret knew well the objects of these
absences, but they would have made themselves
very unpopular if they had spoken of them.
Smuggling was a thing every one had a hand
in; rich and poor alike had their venture, and
a wise ignorance, and deaf and dumb ignoring of
the fact, was a social tenet universally observed.
If Jan came home and brought his wife a piece
of rich silk or lace, or a gold trinket, she took
it without any unpleasant curiosity. If Peter
were offered a cask of French brandy at a
nominal price, he never asked any embarrassing
questions. Consciences tender enough toward
the claims of God, evaded without a scruple the
rendering of C&#230;sar&#8217;s dues.</p>
<p>So when Jan disappeared for a few weeks,
and then returned with money in his pocket,
and presents for his friends, he was welcomed
without question. And he liked the life; liked
it so well that when the next fishing season
came round he refused every offer made him.
He gained more with Hol Skager, and the excitement
of eluding the coast guard or of giving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
them a good chase, suited Jan exactly. The
spirit of his forefathers ruled him absolutely,
and he would have fought for his cargo or gone
down with the ship.</p>
<p>Snorro was very proud of him. The morality
of Jan&#8217;s employment he never questioned, and
Jan&#8217;s happy face and fine clothing gave him
the greatest pleasure. He was glad that he
had escaped Peter&#8217;s control; and when Jan,
now and then, went to the store after it was
shut, and sat an hour with him, no man in Shetland
was as proud and happy as Michael
Snorro. Very often Jan brought him a book,
and on one occasion it was the wondrous old
&#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress,&#8221; full of wood-cuts. That
book was a lifelong joy to Snorro, and he
gave to Jan all the thanks and the credit of it.
&#8220;Jan brought him every thing pleasant he had.
He was so handsome, and so clever, and so
good, and yet he loved him&mdash;the poor, ignorant
Snorro!&#8221; So Snorro reasoned, and accordingly
he loved his friend with all his soul.</p>
<p>At Jan&#8217;s house many changes were taking
place. In the main, Margaret had her house
very much to herself. No one soiled its exquisite
cleanliness. The expense of keeping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
it was small. She was saving money on every
hand. When Jan came home with a rich present
in his hand, it was easy to love so handsome
and generous a man, and if Jan permitted
her to love him in her own way, she was very
glad to do so. The tie between man and wife
is one hard to break. What tugs it will
bear for years, we have all seen and wondered
at; and during this interval if there were
days when they were wretched, there were many
others when they were very happy together.
The conditions rested mainly with Margaret.
When she could forget all her small ambitions
and disappointments, and give to her
husband the smile and kiss he still valued
above every thing, then Jan was proud and
happy and anxious to please her. But Margaret
was moody as the skies above her, and
sometimes Jan&#8217;s sunniest tempers were in
themselves an offense. It is ill indeed with
the man who is bound to misery by the cords
of a woman&#8217;s peevish and unreasonable
temper.</p>
<p>For a year and a half Jan remained with Hol
Skager, but during this time his whole nature
deteriorated. Among the Shetland fishermen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
mutual forbearance and mutual reliance was
the rule. In position the men were nearly
equal, and there was no opportunity for an
overbearing spirit to exercise itself. But it was
very different with Skager&#8217;s men. They were
of various nationalities, and of reckless and
unruly tempers. The strictest discipline was
necessary, and Jan easily learned to be tyrannical
and unjust, to use passionate and profane language,
to drink deep, and to forget the Sabbath,
a day which had been so sacred to him.</p>
<p>In his own home the change was equally
apparent. Margaret began to tremble before
the passions she evoked; and Jan to mock at
the niceties that had hitherto snubbed and
irritated him. Once he had been so easy to
please; now all her small conciliations sometimes
failed. The day had gone by for them.
The more she humbled herself, the less Jan
seemed to care for her complaisance. To be
kind too late, to be kind when the time for
kindness is passed by, that is often the greatest
injury of all.</p>
<p>At the end of eighteen months Jan and
Skager quarreled. Skager had become intimate
with Peter Fae, and Peter was doubtless to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
blame. At any rate, Jan was sure he was, and
he spent his days in morose complaining, and
futile threats of vengeance&mdash;futile, because the
poor man&#8217;s wrath always falls upon himself.
When Peter heard them he could afford to say
contemptuously&mdash;&#8220;It is well known that Jan
Vedder has a long tongue and short hands;&#8221;
or, &#8220;Between saying and doing the thing is a
great way.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a few weeks even Ragon Torr got weary
of Jan&#8217;s ill-temper and heroics. Besides, he
was in his debt, and there seemed no prospect
of speedy work for him. Upon the whole, it
was a miserable winter for the Vedders. Jan
made very little. Sometimes he killed a seal,
or brought in a bag of birds, but his earnings
were precarious, and Margaret took care that
his table should be in accordance. She had
money, of course, but it was her own money,
and a thing with which Jan had no right. She
ate her meager fare of salt fish and barley bread
with a face of perfect resignation; she gave up
her servant and made no complaints, and she
did think it a most shameful injustice that,
after all, Jan should be cross with her. It did
not strike her, that good meal, even though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
she had procured it from her own private hoard,
might have been a better thing than the most
saintly patience. There is much said about
the wickedness of doing evil that good may
come. Alas! there is such a thing as doing
good that evil may come.</p>
<p>One afternoon in early spring Jan saw a flock
of wild swans soaring majestically on their
strong wings toward a lake which was a favorite
resting place with them. He took his gun and
followed after. They were gathered in the
very middle of the lake; his dog could not
swim so far, neither could his shot reach them.
It seemed as if every promise mocked him.
Sulky and disappointed, he was returning home
when he met the Udaller Tulloch. He was
jogging along on his little rough pony, his
feet raking the ground, and his prehistoric hat
tied firmly on the back of his head.</p>
<p>But in spite of his primitive appearance he
was a man of wealth and influence, the banker
of the island, liked and trusted of all men&mdash;except
Peter Fae. With Peter he had come often
in conflict; he had superseded him in a civil
office, he had spoken slightingly of some of
Peter&#8217;s speculations, and, above all offenses, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
a recent kirk election he had been chosen
Deacon instead of Peter. They were the two
rich men of Lerwick, and they were jealous and
distrustful of each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan Vedder,&#8221; said Tulloch, cheerily, &#8220;I
would speak with thee; come to my house
within an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not so fine a house as Peter&#8217;s, but Jan
liked its atmosphere. Small glass barrels of
brandy stood on the sideboard; there was a
case of Hollands in the chimney corner; fine
tobacco, bloaters, and sturgeons&#8217; roes were in
comfortable proximity. A bright fire of peats
glowed on the ample hearth, and the Udaller
sat eating and drinking before it. He made
Jan join him, and without delay entered upon
his business.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to sell &#8216;The Solan,&#8217; Jan. She is worth
a thousand pounds for a coaster; or, if thou
wishes, thou could spoil Skager&#8217;s trips with her.
She is half as broad as she is long, with high
bilge, and a sharp bottom; the very boat for
these seas&mdash;wilt thou buy her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had the money, nothing would be so
much to my liking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, thy wife brought me £50 yesterday;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
that makes thy account a little over
£600. I will give thee a clear bill of sale and
trust thee for the balance. &#8217;Tis a great pity to
see a good lad like thee going to waste. It is
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I was in thy debt, then thou would own
a part of me. I like well to be my own master.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A skipper at sea doth what he will; and
every one knows that Jan Vedder is not one
that serves. Remember, thou wilt be skipper
of thy&mdash;own&mdash;boat!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan&#8217;s eyes flashed joyfully, but he said, &#8220;My
wife may not like I should use the money for
this purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a new thing for a man to ask his wife
if he can spend this or that, thus or so. And
to what good? Margaret Vedder would speak
to her father, and thou knows if Peter Fae love
thee&mdash;or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>These words roused the worst part of Jan&#8217;s
nature. He remembered, in a moment, all the
envy and wonder he would cause by sailing out
of harbor skipper of his own boat. It was the
very temptation that was irresistible to him. He
entered into Tulloch&#8217;s plan with all his heart,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
and before he left him he was in a mood to
justify any action which would further his desire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only give not thy thoughts speech, Jan,&#8221;
said Tulloch at parting; &#8220;and above all things,
trust not thy plans to a woman. When will
thou tell me &#8216;yes&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jan was not the man to hold counsel
with his own soul. He wanted human advice
and sympathy, and he felt sure of Snorro. He
went straight to him, but the store was still
open, and Peter Fae was standing in the door,
three of his neighbors with him. He looked at
Jan scornfully and asked&mdash;&#8220;Well, how many
swans did thou get?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been after a purchase, Peter Fae.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. How wilt thou pay for it, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will take my own to pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter laughed, and turning away, answered,
&#8220;Why, then, do I speak to thee? Only God
understands fools.&#8221;</p>
<p>This conversation irritated Jan far more
than many an actual wrong had done. &#8220;I have
indeed been a fool,&#8221; he said to Snorro, &#8220;but
now I will look well to what concerns my own
interest.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></div>
<p>Then he told Michael of Tulloch&#8217;s offer, and
added, &#8220;At last, then, I have the sum of my
wife&#8217;s savings, and I will show her she has been
saving for a good end. What dost thou think,
Snorro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the money is thine. All thine has
been hers, or she had not saved so much; all
hers ought then to be thine. But it is well and
right to tell her of Tulloch&#8217;s offer to thee. She
may like to give thee as a gift what else thou
must take without any pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan laughed; it was an unpleasant laugh,
and did not at all brighten his face, but he
resolved to a certain extent on taking Snorro&#8217;s
advice. It was quite midnight when he reached
his home, but Margaret was sitting by a few
red peats knitting. She was weeping, also, and
her tears annoyed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art ever crying like a cross child,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Now what art thou crying for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For thy love, my husband. If thou would
care a little for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is also what I say. If thou would
care a little for me and for my well-doing! Listen,
now! I have heard where I can buy a
good boat for £600. Wilt thou ask thy father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
for so much of thy tocher? To have this boat,
Margaret, would make me the happiest man in
Shetland. I know that thou can manage it if
thou wilt. Dear wife, do this thing for me. I
ask thee with all my heart.&#8221; And he bent
toward her, took the knitting away, and held
her hands in his own.</p>
<p>Margaret dropped her eyes, and Jan watched
her with a painful interest. Did she love him
or her £600 better? Her face paled and flushed.
She looked up quickly, and her lips parted.
Jan believed that she was going to say&mdash;&#8220;I
have £600, and I will gladly give it to thee.&#8221;
He was ready to fold her to his breast, to love
her, as he had loved her that day when he had
first called her &#8220;wife.&#8221; Alas! after a slight hesitation,
she dropped her pale face and answered
slowly&mdash;&#8220;I will not ask my father. I might as
well ask the sea for fresh water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan let her hands fall, and stood up. &#8220;I see
now that all talk with thee will come to little.
What thou wants, is that men should give thee
all, and thou give nothing. When thou sayest,
&#8216;thy love, husband,&#8217; thou means &#8216;thy money,
husband;&#8217; and if there is no money, then there
is ever sighs and tears. Many things thou hast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
yet to learn of a wife&#8217;s duty, and very soon I
will give thee a lesson I had done well to teach
thee long since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have borne much from thee, Jan, but at
the next wrong thou does me, I will go back to
my father. That is what I shall do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will see to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we will see!&#8221; And she rose proudly,
and with flashing eyes gathered up her knitting
and her wool and left the room.</p>
<p>The next morning Jan and Tulloch concluded
their bargain. &#8220;The Solan&#8221; was put in thorough
order, and loaded with a coasting cargo. It
was supposed that Tulloch&#8217;s nephew would sail
her, and Jan judged it wisest to show no interest
in the matter. But an hour after all was
ready, he drew the £600 out of Tulloch&#8217;s bank,
paid it down for the boat, and sailed her out of
Lerwick harbor at the noon-tide. In ten minutes
afterward a score of men had called in
Peter Fae&#8217;s store and told him.</p>
<p>He was both puzzled and annoyed. Why
had Tulloch interfered with Jan unless it was
for his, Peter&#8217;s, injury? From the secrecy
maintained, he suspected some scheme against
his interests. Snorro, on being questioned,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
could truthfully say that Jan had not told him
he was to leave Lerwick that morning; in fact,
Jan had purposely left Snorro ignorant of his
movements. But the good fellow could not
hide the joy he felt, and Peter looked at him
wrathfully.</p>
<p>It was seldom Peter went to see his daughter,
but that evening he made her a call. Whatever
she knew she would tell him, and he did
not feel as if he could rest until he got the clue
to Jan&#8217;s connection with Tulloch. But when
he named it to Margaret, he found she was
totally ignorant of Jan&#8217;s departure. The news
shocked her. Her work dropped from her
hand; she was faint with fear and amazement.
Jan had never before left her in anger, without
a parting word or kiss. Her father&#8217;s complaints
and fears about Tulloch she scarcely heeded.
Jan&#8217;s behavior toward herself was the only
thought in her mind. Peter learned nothing
from her; but his irritation was much increased
by what he considered Margaret&#8217;s unreasonable
sorrow over a bad husband. He could not
bear a crying woman, and his daughter&#8217;s sobs
angered him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come thou home to thy mother,&#8221; he said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
&#8220;when thy eyes are dry; but bring no tears to
my house for Jan Vedder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Margaret remembered that she had
threatened Jan with this very thing. Evidently
he had dared her to do it by this new neglect
and unkindness. She wandered up and down
the house, full of wretched fears and memories;
love, anger, pride, each striving for the mastery.
Perhaps the bitterest of all her thoughts toward
her husband arose from the humiliating
thought of &#8220;what people would say.&#8221; For
Margaret was a slave to a wretched thraldom
full of every possible tragedy&mdash;she would see
much of her happiness or misery through the
eyes of others.</p>
<p>She felt bitterly that night that her married
life had been a failure; but failures are generally
brought about by want of patience and
want of faith. Margaret had never had much
patience with Jan; she had lost all faith in
him. &#8220;Why should she not go home as her
father told her?&#8221; This question she kept
asking herself. Jan had disappointed all her
hopes. As for Jan&#8217;s hopes, she did not ask
herself any questions about them. She looked
around the handsome home she had given him;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
she considered the profitable business which
might have been his on her father&#8217;s retirement
or death; and she thought a man must be
wicked who could regard lightly such blessings.
As she passed a glass she gazed upon her own
beauty with a mournful smile and thought
anew, how unworthy of all Jan had been.</p>
<p>At daybreak she began to put carefully away
such trifles of household decoration as she
valued most. Little ornaments bought in
Edinburgh, pieces of fancy work done in her
school days, fine china, or glass, or napery.
She had determined to lock up the house and
go to her father&#8217;s until Jan returned. Then
he would be obliged to come for her, and in
any dispute she would at least have the benefit
of a strong position. Even with this thought,
full as it was of the most solemn probabilities,
there came into her niggardly calculations the
consideration of its economy. She would not
only save all the expenses of housekeeping,
but all her time could be spent in making fine
knitted goods, and a great many garments
might thus be prepared before the annual fair.</p>
<p>This train of ideas suggested her bank book.
That must certainly go with her, and a faint
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
smile crossed her face as she imagined the surprise
of her father and mother at the amount
it vouched for&mdash;that was, if she concluded to
tell them. She went for it; of course it was
gone. At first she did not realize the fact;
then, as the possibility of its loss smote her, she
trembled with terror, and hurriedly turned
over and over the contents of the drawer.
&#8220;<i>Gone!</i>&#8221; She said it with a quick, sharp cry,
like that of a woman mortally wounded. She
could find it nowhere, and after five minutes&#8217;
search, she sat down upon her bedside, and
abandoned herself to agonizing grief.</p>
<p>Yes, it was pitiable. She had begun the
book with pennies saved from sweeties and
story-books, from sixpences, made by knitting
through hours when she would have liked to
play. The ribbons and trinkets of her girlhood
and maidenhood were in it, besides many a
little comfort that Jan and herself had been
defrauded of. Her hens had laid for it, her
geese been plucked for it, her hands had constantly
toiled for it. It had been the idol upon
the hearthstone to which had been offered up
the happiness of her youth, and before which
love lay slain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>At first its loss was all she could take in, but
very quickly she began to connect the loss with
Jan, and with the £600 he had asked her to
get for him at their last conversation. With
this conviction her tears ceased, her face grew
hard and white as ice. If Jan had used her
money she was sure that she would never speak
to him, never see him again. At that hour she
almost hated him. He was only the man who
had taken her £600. She forgot that he had
been her lover and her husband. As soon as
she could control herself she fled to her father&#8217;s
house, and kneeling down by Peter&#8217;s side
sobbed out the trouble that had filled her cup
to overflowing.</p>
<p>This was a sorrow Peter could heartily sympathize
with. He shed tears of anger and mortification,
as he wiped away those of his daughter.
It was a great grief to him that he could
not prosecute Jan for theft. But he was quite
aware that the law recognized Jan&#8217;s entire right
to whatever was his wife&#8217;s. Neither the father
nor daughter remembered how many years Jan
had respected his wife&#8217;s selfishness, and forgiven
her want of confidence in him; the thing
he had done was an unpardonable wrong.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></div>
<p>Thora said very little. She might have
reminded Peter that he had invested all her fortune
in his business, that he always pocketed
her private earnings. But to what purpose?
She did not much blame Jan for taking at last,
what many husbands would have taken at first,
but she was angry enough at his general unkindness
to Margaret. Yet it was not without
many forebodings of evil she saw Peter store
away in an empty barn all the pretty furniture
of Margaret&#8217;s house, and put the key of
the deserted house in his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am so miserable!&#8221; wailed the
wretched wife, morning, noon, and night. Her
money and her husband supplied her with
perpetual lamentations, varied only by pitiful
defenses of her own conduct: &#8220;My house was
ever clean and comfortable! No man&#8217;s table
was better served! I was never idle! I wasted
nothing! I never was angry! And yet I am
robbed, and betrayed, and deserted! There
never was so miserable a woman&mdash;so unjustly
miserable!&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas! my child,&#8221; said Thora, one day, &#8220;did
you then expect to drink of the well of happiness
before death? This is the great saying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
which we all forget: <i>There</i>&mdash;not here&mdash;<i>there</i>
the wicked cease from troubling; <i>there</i> the
weary are at rest. <i>There</i> God has promised to
wipe away all tears, but not here, Margaret,
<i>not here</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man I am, crossed with adversity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is some soul of goodness in things evil;</p>

</div></div>
<p>No man set more nakedly side by side the
clay and spirit of his double nature than
Jan Vedder. No man wished so much and willed
so little. Long before he returned from his
first voyage, he became sorry for the deception
he had practiced upon his wife, and determined
to acknowledge to her his fault, as far as he saw
it to be a fault. He was so little fond of money,
that it was impossible for him to understand
the full extent of Margaret&#8217;s distress; but he
knew, at least, that she would be deeply grieved,
and he was quite willing to promise her, that as
soon as The Solan was clear of debt, he
would begin to repay her the money she prized
so much.</p>
<p>Her first voyage was highly successful, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
was, as usual, sanguine beyond all reasonable
probabilities; quite sure, indeed, that Tulloch
and Margaret could both be easily paid off in
two years. Surely two years was a very short
time for a wife to trust her husband with £600.
Arguing, then, from his own good intentions,
and his own hopes and calculations, he had persuaded
himself before he reached Lerwick again that the
forced loan was really nothing to
make any fuss about, that it would doubtless be
a very excellent thing, and that Margaret would
be sure to see it as he did.</p>
<p>The Solan touched Lerwick in the afternoon.
Jan sent a message to Tulloch, and
hastened to his home. Even at a distance the
lonely air of the place struck him unpleasantly.
There was no smoke from the chimneys, the
windows were all closed. At first he thought
&#8220;Margaret is gone for a day&#8217;s visit somewhere&mdash;it
is unlucky then.&#8221; But as he reached the
closed gate other changes made themselves
apparent. His Newfoundland dog, that had
always known his step afar off, and came
bounding to meet him, did not answer his
whistle. Though he called Brenda, his pet
seal, repeatedly, she came not; she, that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
always met him with an almost human affection.
He perceived before his feet touched the
threshold how it was: Margaret had gone to
her father&#8217;s, or the animals and poultry would
have been in the yard.</p>
<p>His first impulse was to follow her there and
bring her home, and he felt in his pocket for
the golden chain and locket he had brought her
as a peace-offering. Then he reflected that
by the time he could reach Peter&#8217;s house it
would be the tea-hour, and he did not intend
to discuss the differences between Margaret and
himself in Peter&#8217;s presence. Thora&#8217;s good
influence he could count upon; but he knew it
would be useless either to reason with or propitiate
Peter. For fully five minutes he stood
at his bolted door wondering what to do. He
felt his position a cruel one; just home from a
prosperous voyage, and no one to say a kind
word. Yes, he could go to Torr&#8217;s; he would
find a welcome there. But the idea of the
noisy room and inquisitive men was disagreeable
to him. Snorro he could not see for some
hours. He determined at last that the quiet of
his own lonely home was the best place in
which to consider this new phase of affairs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
between him and his wife, and while doing so
he could make a cup of tea, and wash and
refresh himself before the interview.</p>
<p>He unfastened the kitchen shutter and leaped
in. Then the sense of his utter desolation
smote him. Mechanically he walked through
the despoiled, dusty, melancholy rooms. Not
a stool left on which he could sit down. He
laughed aloud&mdash;that wretched laugh of reckless
sorrow, that is far more pitiful than weeping.
Then he went to Torr&#8217;s. People had seen him
on the way to his home, and no one had been
kind enough to prevent his taking the useless,
wretched journey. He felt deeply wounded
and indignant. There were not half a dozen
men or women in Lerwick whose position in
regard to Jan would have excused their interference,
but of that he did not think. Every
man and woman knew his shame and wrong.
Some one might have warned him. Torr
shook his head sympathetically at Jan&#8217;s complaints,
and gave him plenty of liquor, and in
an hour he had forgotten his grief in a drunken
stupor.</p>
<p>The next morning he went to Peter&#8217;s house
to see his wife. Peter knew of his arrival, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
he had informed himself of all that had happened
in Torr&#8217;s room. Jan had, of course,
spoken hastily and passionately, and had drunk
deeply, and none of his faults had been kept
from Margaret. She had expected him to
come at once for her, to be in a passion probably,
and to say some hard things, but she also
had certainly thought he would say them to
her, and not to strangers. Hour after hour
she watched, sick with longing and fear and
anger, hour after hour, until Peter came in,
stern and dour, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Get thee to thy bed, Margaret. Jan
Vedder has said words of thee this night
that are not to be forgiven, and he is now
fathoms deep in Torr&#8217;s liquor. See thou speak
not with him&mdash;good nor bad,&#8221; and Peter
struck the table so angrily, that both women
were frightened into a silence, which he took
for consent.</p>
<p>So when Jan asked to see his wife, Thora
stood in the door, and in her sad, still way told
him that Peter had left strict orders against his
entering the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;But thou, mother, wilt ask Margaret to
come out here and speak to me? Yes, thou
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
wilt do that,&#8221; and he eagerly pressed in Thora&#8217;s
hand the little present he had brought. &#8220;Give
her this, and tell her I wait here for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>After ten minutes&#8217; delay, Thora returned and
gave him the trinket back. Margaret wanted
her £600 and not a gold locket, and Jan had
not even sent her a message about it. His
return had brought back the memory of her
loss in all its first vividness. She had had a
dim hope that Jan would bring her money
with him, that he had only taken it to frighten
her; to lose this hope was to live over again
her first keen sorrow. In this mood it was
easy for her to say that she would not see him,
or speak to him, or accept his gift; let him
give her back her £600, that was the whole
burden of her answer.</p>
<p>Jan put the unfortunate peace-offering in
his pocket, and walked away without a word.
&#8220;He will trouble thee no more, Margaret,&#8221;
said Thora, quietly. Margaret fancied there
was a tone of reproach or regret in the voice.
It angered her anew, and she answered, &#8220;It is
well; it were better if he had never come at
all.&#8221; But in her heart she expected Jan to
come, and come again, until she pardoned him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
She had no intention of finally casting him off.
She meant that he should suffer sufficiently to
insure his future good behavior. She had to
suffer with him, and she regarded this as the
hardest and most unjust part of the discipline.
She, who had always done her duty in all
things.</p>
<p>It is true she had permitted her father to
dismantle their home, but she had had a
distinct reason for that, and one which she
intended to have told Jan, had he come back
under circumstances to warrant the confidence.
In fact she had begun to dislike the house very
much. It was too small, too far away from her
mother, and from the town; besides which,
Peter had the very house she longed for vacant,
and she hoped so to manage her father, as to
make the exchange she wished. Perhaps, too,
she was a little bit superstitious. No one had
ever been lucky in the house in which she and
Jan had lived. She sometimes felt angry at
her father for thrusting it upon them. Even
Elga Skade&#8217;s love affairs had all gone wrong
there, and the girl was sure some malicious
sprite had power within its walls to meddle
and make trouble. Elga had left her, influenced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
entirely by this superstition, and Margaret
had brooded upon it, until it had obtained
some influence over her; otherwise, she would
not have permitted her father to dismantle the
unhappy home without a protest.</p>
<p>As it was, with all its faults she was beginning
to miss the independence it gave her. No
married woman ever goes back to the best of
homes, and takes the place of her maidenhood.
Her new servant, Trolla Bork, had warned her
often of this. &#8220;When Bork was drowned,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;I went back to my parents, but I did
not go back to my home. No, indeed! There
is a difference, even where there is no unkindness.
Thy own home is a full cup. Weep, if
thou must weep, at thy own fireside.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Margaret&#8217;s refusal to see Jan, he went
back to his boat, and employed himself all day
about her cargo, and in settling accounts with
Tulloch. It was very late when he went to see
Snorro. But Snorro was waiting for him. Now
that things had come to a crisis he was ready to
hear all Jan&#8217;s complaints; he believed him in
all things to have done right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou hast asked her once, Jan,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;that was well and right. Thou shalt not go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
again. No, indeed! Let her come and tell thee
she is sorry. Then thou can show her a man&#8217;s
heart, and forgive her freely, without yea or
nay in the matter. What right had she to pull
thy house to pieces without thy knowledge?
Come, now, and I will show thee the place I
have made for thee when thou art in Lerwick.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a big loft over Peter&#8217;s store, with
a narrow ladder-like stair to it. It was full of
the lumber of thirty years and tenanted by a
colony of Norway rats, who were on the most
familiar terms with Snorro. Many of them
answered to their names, none were afraid to
eat from his hand; one old shrewd fellow, gray
with age, often crept into Snorro&#8217;s bosom, and
in the warmth, lay hour after hour, watching
with wise, weird eyes the quiet face it trusted
as it bent over a book.</p>
<p>There was a corner in this garret with a window
looking seaward, and here Snorro had
cleared a small space, and boarded it up like a
room. A bed of down and feathers, with a
cover of seal-skins occupied one side; two rude
seats, a big goods-box turned up for a table,
and some shelves full of the books Jan had
brought him, completed its furniture.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>&#8220;See here, Jan, I have been fifteen years
with Peter Fae, and no feet but mine have ever
entered this loft. Here thou canst be at peace.
My dear Jan, lie thee down, and sleep now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan was glad to do it. He put the gold
locket on Snorro&#8217;s table, and said, &#8220;Thou keep
it. I bought it for her, and she sent it back
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day she will be glad of it. Be thou
sure of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the summer Jan made short and
quick voyages, and so he spent many an hour
in this little retreat talking with Snorro, for
he had much to annoy and trouble him. We
do not get over living sorrows as easily as dead
ones. Margaret in her grave would have lost
the power to wound him, and he would gradually
have ceased to lament her. But Margaret
weeping in her father&#8217;s house; Margaret praying
in the kirk for strength to bear his neglect
and injustice; Margaret throwing open the Bluebeard
chamber of their home, and discussing
its tragedy with his enemies; this was a sorrow
there was no forgetting. On his return from
every voyage he sent her the money he had
made, and some little token of his love with it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
She always sent both back without a word. She
understood from them that Jan would come no
more in person, and that she would have to make
the next advance, either by voice or letter.
Many times she had declared she would never
do this, and the declaration even in her tenderest
hours, bound her to her self-inflicted loneliness
and grief. So on Snorro&#8217;s rude table the
pretty womanly trinkets accumulated, and
Snorro looked at them with constantly gathering
anger.</p>
<p>One morning in October he heard a thing
that made his heart leap. The physician of the
town hurried into the store, and cried, &#8220;Peter
Fae, here hath come a little man to thy house.
A handsome lad he is, indeed. Now then, go
and see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What of my daughter, Doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will do well enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snorro lifted never an eyelash, but his face
glowed like fire. Jan, then, had a son! Jan&#8217;s
son! Already he loved the child. Surely he
would be the peacemaker. Now the mother
and father must meet. He had almost forgiven
Margaret. How he longed for Jan to
come back. Alas! when he did, Margaret was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
said to be dying; Peter had not been at his
store for three days.</p>
<p>The double news met Jan as soon as he put
his foot on the quay. &#8220;Thou hast a son, Jan.&#8221;
&#8220;Thy wife is dying.&#8221; Jan was nearly distraught.
With all a man&#8217;s strength of feeling,
he had emotions as fervent and vivid as a
woman: he forgot in a moment every angry
feeling, and hastened to his wife. Peter opened
the door; when he saw Jan, he could have
struck him. He did what was more cruel, he
shut the door in his face, and drew the bolt
passionately across it.</p>
<p>Jan, however, would not leave the vicinity.
He stopped the doctor, and every one that
came and went. In a few hours this became
intolerable to Peter. He ordered him to go
away, but Jan sat on a large stone by the gate,
with his head in his hands, and answered him
never a word. Then he sent Thora to him. In
vain Jan tried to soften her heart. &#8220;Margaret
is unconscious, yet she mourns constantly for
thee. Thou art my child&#8217;s murderer,&#8221; she
said sternly. &#8220;Go thy ways before I curse thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned away then and went down to the
seaside, and threw himself, in an agony of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
despair, upon the sand and the yellow tangle.
Hour after hour passed; physical exhaustion
and mental grief produced at length a kind of
lethargy, that oblivion, rather than sleep, which
comes to souls which have felt till they can feel
no longer.</p>
<p>Just at dark some one touched him, and
asked sternly, &#8220;Art thou drunk, Jan Vedder,
to-day? To-day, when thy wife is dying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is with sorrow I am drunk.&#8221; Then he
opened his eyes and saw the minister standing
over him. Slowly he rose to his feet, and stood
stunned and trembling before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan! Go to thy wife. She is very ill. At
the last she may want thee and only thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will not let me see her. Do thou
speak to Peter Fae for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hast thou not seen her&mdash;or thy son?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not been within the door. Oh, do
thou speak for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Together they went back to Peter&#8217;s house.
The door was locked, and the minister knocked.
&#8220;Who is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I, and Jan Vedder. Peter, unbolt the
door.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thou art God&#8217;s minister and ever welcome;
but I will not let Jan Vedder cross my door-stone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wilt let us both in. Indeed thou wilt.
I am amazed at thee, Peter. What God has
joined together, let no man put asunder. Art
thou going to strive against God? I say to thee,
unbolt the door, unbolt it quick, lest thou be
too late. If thou suffer not mercy to pass
through it, I tell thee there are those who will
pass through it, the door being shut.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Peter drew the bolt and set the door
wide, but his face was hard as iron, and black
as midnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan,&#8221; said the minister, &#8220;thy wife and child
are in the next room. Go and see them, it will
be good for thee. Peter, well may the Lord
Christ say, &#8216;I come as a thief in the night&#8217;;
and be sure of this, he will break down the bars
and burst open the doors of those who rise not
willingly to let him in.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Shetland at that day, and indeed at the
present day, the minister has almost a papal
authority. Peter took the reproof in silence.
Doctor Balloch was, however, a man who in any
circumstances would have had influence and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
authority among those brought in contact with
him, for though he spared not the rod in the
way of his ministry, he was in all minor matters
full of gentleness and human kindness.
Old and young had long ago made their hearts
over to him. Besides, his great learning and
his acquaintance with the tongues of antiquity
were regarded as a great credit to the town.</p>
<p>While Jan was in his wife&#8217;s presence, Doctor
Balloch stood silent, looking into the fire:
Peter gazed out of the window. Neither spoke
until Jan returned. Then the minister turned
and looked at the young man. It was plain
that he was on the verge of insensibility again.
He took his arm and led him to a couch. &#8220;Lie
down, Jan;&#8221; then turning to Peter he said,
&#8220;Thy son has had no food to-day. He is faint
and suffering. Let thy women make him some
tea, and bring him some bread and meat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have said that he shall not eat bread in
my house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then thou hast said an evil and uncharitable
thing. Unsay it, Peter. See, the lad is
fainting!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not mend that. He shall not break
bread in my house.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then I say this to thee. Thou shalt not
break bread at thy Lord&#8217;s supper in His house.
No, thou shalt not, for thou would be doing it
unworthily, and eating damnation to thyself.
What saith thy Lord Christ? If thine enemy
hunger, feed him. Now, then, order the bread
and tea for Jan Vedder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter called a woman servant and gave the
order. Then, almost in a passion, he faced the
minister, and said, &#8220;Oh, sir, if thou knew the
evil this man hath done me and mine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In such a case Christ&#8217;s instructions are very
plain&mdash;&#8216;Overcome evil with good.&#8217; Now, thou
knowest thy duty. If thou sin, I have warned
thee&mdash;the sin is on thy own head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan heard nothing of this conversation. The
voices of the two men were only like spent
waves breaking on the shores of his consciousness.
But very soon a woman brought him a
basin of hot tea, and he drank it and ate a few
mouthfuls. It gave him a little strength, he
gathered himself together, opened the door,
and without speaking went out into the night.
The minister followed, watching him carefully,
until he saw Michael Snorro take him in his big
arms, and carry him to a pile of seal-skins.
Then he knew that he was in good hands.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>Poor Jan! He was utterly spent and miserable.
The few minutes he had passed at
Margaret&#8217;s side, had brought him no comfort.
He heard her constantly muttering his name,
but it was in the awful, far-distant voice of a
soul speaking through a dream. She was
unconscious of his presence; he trembled in
hers. Just for a moment Thora had allowed
him to lift his son, and to press the tiny face
against his own. Then all was darkness, and a
numb, aching sorrow, until he found himself in
Snorro&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>Many days Margaret Vedder lay between
life and death, but at length there was hope,
and Jan sailed again. He went away very
miserable, though he had fully determined it
should be his last voyage if Margaret wished it
so. He would see her on his return, he would
tell her how sorry he was, he would sell The
Solan and give back the £600; he would even
humble himself to Peter, and go back to the
store, if there were no other way to make
peace with Margaret. He felt that no personal
sacrifice would be too great, if by it he could
win back his home, and wife, and son. The
babe had softened his heart. He told himself&mdash;oh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
so often&mdash;&#8220;Thou art a father;&#8221; and no
man could have had a sweeter, stronger sense
of the obligations the new relation imposed.
He was so sure of himself that he could not
help feeling equally sure of Margaret, and also
of Peter. &#8220;For the child&#8217;s sake, they will forgive
me, Snorro, and I&#8217;ll do well, yes, I will do
well for the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snorro had many fears, but he could not
bear to throw cold water on Jan&#8217;s hopes and
plans for reformation. He did not believe that
his unconditional surrender would be a good
foundation for future happiness. He did not
like Jan&#8217;s taking the whole blame. He did
not like his giving up The Solan at Margaret&#8217;s
word. Neither Peter Fae, nor his daughter,
were likely to exalt any one who humbled
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is money in the hand that wins,&#8221; said
Snorro, gloomily, &#8220;and my counsel is, that thou
bear thyself bravely, and show her how well
The Solan hath done already, and how likely
she is to clear herself and pay back that weariful
£600 before two years have gone away. If
she will have it, let her have it. Jan, how could
she give thee up for £600! Did she love thee?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I do believe she did&mdash;and does yet,
Snorro.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only God, then, understands women. But
while thou art away, think well of this and that,
and of the things likely to follow, for still I
see that forethought spares afterthought and
after-sorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>With words like these ringing in his ears,
Jan again sailed The Solan out of Lerwick.
He intended to make a coasting voyage only,
but he expected delay, for with November had
come storm and cold, fierce winds and roaring
seas. Edging along from port to port, taking
advantage of every tide and favorable breeze,
and lying to, when sailing was impossible,
six weeks were gone before he reached Kirkwall
in the Orkneys. Here he intended to
take in his last cargo before steering for home.
A boat leaving Kirkwall as he entered, carried
the news of The Solan&#8217;s arrival to Lerwick,
and then Snorro watched anxiously every tide
for Jan&#8217;s arrival.</p>
<p>But day after day passed and The Solan
came not. No one but Snorro was uneasy. In
the winter, in that tempestuous latitude, boats
were often delayed for weeks. They ran from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
shelter to shelter in constant peril of shipwreck,
and with a full cargo a good skipper
was bound to be prudent. But Snorro had a
presentiment of danger and trouble. He
watched night after night for Jan, until even
his strength gave way, and he fell into a deep
sleep. He was awakened by Jan&#8217;s voice. In
a moment he opened the door and let him
in.</p>
<p>Alas! Alas, poor Jan! It was sorrow upon
sorrow for him. The Solan had been driven
upon the Quarr rocks, and she was a total
wreck. Nothing had been saved but Jan&#8217;s
life, even that barely. He had been so bruised
and injured that he had been compelled to rest
in the solitary hut of a coast-guardsman many
days. He gave the facts to Snorro in an
apathy. The man was shipwrecked as well as
the boat. It was not only that he had lost
every thing, that he had not a penny left in the
world, he had lost hope, lost all faith in himself,
lost even the will to fight his ill fortune any
longer.</p>

</div></div>
<p>Jan, the sole survivor of The Solan, had
brought the news of his own misfortune,
but there was no necessity to hasten its publication.
Nothing could be gained by telling it
at once, and no one could be helped, so Snorro
advised him to sleep all the following day.
Jan hardly needed the advice. In a few
minutes he sank into a dreamless lethargic
sleep, which lasted nearly twenty-four hours.
When he awoke from it, he said, &#8220;I will see
Tulloch, and then I will sleep again, Snorro.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Let me go for thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, then he will think that I am a coward.
I must tell my own tale; he can but be
angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Tulloch took his loss with composure.
&#8220;Thou did the best that could be done, Jan,&#8221;
he answered, when Jan had told the story of
the shipwreck; &#8220;wind and wave are not at thy
order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wilt say that for me? It is all I ask.
I did my best, Tulloch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will say it; and in the spring I will see
about another boat. I am not afraid to trust
thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan looked at him gratefully, but the hope
was too far off to give much present comfort to
him. He walked slowly back to the retreat
Snorro had made for him, wondering how he
was to get the winter over, wondering if Margaret
would see him, wondering how best to
gain her forgiveness, longing to see her face but
not daring to approach her without some preparation
for the meeting. For though she had
come back to life, it had been very slowly.
Snorro said that she never left the house, that
she was still wan and weak, and that on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
rare occasions when he had been sent to Peter&#8217;s
house, she had not spoken to him.</p>
<p>After his interview with Tulloch, he fell into
a sound sleep again. When he awoke the day
was well begun, and Peter was at the store.
Looking through the cracks in the rude flooring,
he could see him carefully counting his
cash, and comparing his balance. Snorro, for
a wonder, was quite idle, and Peter finally
looked at him, and said fretfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is this and that to do. What art
thou standing still for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man may stand still sometimes. I feel
not like work to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Art thou sick, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who can tell? It may be sickness.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood thoughtfully by the big fire and
moved not. Peter went on with his figures in
a fidgety way. Presently Tulloch entered.
The banker&#8217;s visits were rare ones, and Peter
was already suspicious of them. But he laid
down his pen, and with scrupulous civility said,
&#8220;Good morning to thee, Tulloch&mdash;Deacon Tulloch,
I should say. Wilt thou buy or sell
aught this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Fae. I came to thee for
news. Where is thy son Jan staying?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>Peter&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;I know nothing at
all about Jan Vedder. If he is at sea, he is out
of thy world; if he is in harbor, he will be at
Ragon Torr&#8217;s, or on board The Solan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Solan hath gone to pieces on the Quarr
Rocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just for a moment a thrill of sinful triumph
made Peter&#8217;s brown face turn scarlet, but he
checked it instantly. &#8220;I heard not that,&#8221; he
said gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only Jan escaped&mdash;ship and crew went to
the bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter shut his mouth tight, he was afraid to
trust himself to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Jan did his very best, no man could
have done more. I saw him last night. He
is ill and broken down by his trouble. Put out
thy hand to him. Thou do that, and it will be
a good thing, Fae.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou mind thy own affairs, Deacon Tulloch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then it is my affair to tell thee, that
there is a time for anger and a time for forgiveness.
If Jan is to be saved, his wife can
now do it. At this hour he is sick and sore-hearted,
and she can win him back, she can save
him now, Fae.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Shall I lose my child to save Jan Vedder?
What is it to thee? What can thou know
of a father&#8217;s duty? Thou, who never had
child. Deacon thou may be, but thou art
no Dominie, and I will order my household
without thy word, thus or so. Yes, indeed I
will!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that, Fae. I have spoken for a good
man. And let me tell thee, if Margaret Vedder
is thy daughter, she is also Jan&#8217;s wife;
and if I were Jan, I would make her do a
wife&#8217;s duty. If all the women in Shetland
were to run back to their fathers for a little
thing that offended them, there would be an
end of marrying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter laughed scornfully. &#8220;Every one
knows what well-behaved wives old bachelors
have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better to be a bachelor, than have a wife
like poor Jan Vedder has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art talking of my daughter. Wilt thou
mind thy own affairs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant well, Fae. I meant well. Both
thee and I have much need of heaven&#8217;s mercy.
It will be a good thing for us to be merciful.
I am willing to help and trust Jan again. Thou
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
do so too. Now I will say &#8216;good morning&#8217;,
for I see thou art angry at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter was angry, intensely angry. Under
the guise of Christian charity, Tulloch had come
into his store and insulted him. Peter would
believe in no other motive. And yet he was
scarcely just to Tulloch, for his intentions had
first and mainly been sincerely kind ones;
but the tares are ever among the wheat, and it
was true enough that before the interview was
over Tulloch had felt a personal pleasure in his
plain speaking.</p>
<p>Very soon there was a little crowd in Fae&#8217;s
store. It was a cold, blustering day, and its
warmth and company made it a favorite lounging
place. Jan&#8217;s misfortune was the sole topic
of conversation, and Jan&#8217;s absence was unfavorably
criticised. Why did he not come
among his fellows and tell them how it had happened?
Here were good men and a good ship
gone to the bottom, and he had not a word to
say of the matter. They were all curious about
the wreck, and would have liked to pass the
long stormy day in talking it over. As it was,
they had only conjectures. No one but Tulloch
had seen Jan. They wondered where he was.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>&#8220;At Torr&#8217;s, doubtless,&#8221; said Peter, harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is likely. Jan ever flew to the brandy
keg for comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is like he had been there before he steered
for the Quarr Rocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It did not need brandy. He was ever
careless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was foolhardy more than careless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought that he knew the currents
and the coast, as a man should know it who
has life and goods to carry safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had best be with his crew; every man
of it was a better man than he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snorro let them talk and wonder. He
would not tell them where Jan was. One
group succeeded another, and hour after hour
Snorro stood listening to their conversation,
with shut lips and blazing eyes. Peter looked
at him with increasing irritability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Art thou still sick, Snorro?&#8221; he asked at
length.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, then, art thou idle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am thinking. But the thought is too
much for me. I can make nothing of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Few noticed Snorro&#8217;s remark, but old Jal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
Sinclair said, &#8220;Tell thy thought, Snorro. There
are wise men here to read it for thee; very
wise men, as thou must have noticed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snorro caught something in the old man&#8217;s
face, or in the inflection of his voice, which
gave him an assurance of sympathy, so he
said: &#8220;Well, then, it is this. Jan Vedder is
evidently a very bad man, and a very bad
sailor; yet when Donald Twatt&#8217;s boat sunk in
the <ins title='Was Vor'>Vor</ins> Ness, Jan took his bonnet in his hand,
and he put his last sovereign in it, and he went
up and down Lerwick till he had got £40 for
Twatt. And he gave him a suit of his own
clothes, and he would hear no word wrong of
him, and he said, moreover, that nothing had
happened Twatt but what might happen the
best man and the best sailor that ever lived
when it would be God&#8217;s own time. I thought
that was a good thing in Jan, but no one has
spoke of it to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People have ever thought thee a fool,
Snorro. When thou art eighty years old, as Jal
Sinclair is, perhaps thou wilt know more. Jan
Vedder should have left Twatt to his trouble;
he should have said, &#8216;Twatt is a drunken fellow,
or a careless, foolhardy fellow; he is a bad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
sailor, a bad man, and he ought to have gone
to the bottom.&#8216;&#8221; Then there was a minute&#8217;s
uncomfortable silence, and the men gradually
scattered.</p>
<p>Peter was glad of it. He had no particular
pleasure in any conversation having Jan for a
topic, and he was burning and smarting at
Tulloch&#8217;s interference. It annoyed him also
to see Snorro so boldly taking Jan&#8217;s part. His
indignant face and brooding laziness was a new
element in the store, and it worried Peter far
beyond its importance. He left unusually
early, and then Snorro closed the doors, and
built up the fire, and made some tea, and
broiled mutton and bloaters, and set his few
dishes on the box which served him for a table.
Jan had slept heavily all day, but when Snorro
brought the candle near, he opened his eyes
and said, &#8220;I am hungry, Snorro.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come to tell thee there is tea and
meat waiting. All is closed, and we can eat
and talk, and no one will trouble us.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Shetlander loves his tea, and it pleased
Snorro to see how eagerly Jan drank cup after
cup. And soon his face began to lose its weary,
indifferent look, and he ate with keen relish the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
simple food before him. In an hour Jan was
nearly like himself once more. Then he
remembered Margaret. In the extremity of
his physical weakness and weariness, he had
forgotten every thing in sleep, but now the
delay troubled him. &#8220;I ought to have seen
my wife to-day, Snorro; why did thou let me
sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleep was the first thing, and now we will
see to thy clothes. They must be mended,
Jan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan looked down at the suit he wore. It was
torn and shabby and weather-stained, and it
was all he had. But Snorro was as clever as
any woman with the needle and thread. The
poor fellow, indeed, had never had any woman
friend to use a needle for him, and he soon
darned, and patched, and washed clean what
the winds and waves had left of Jan&#8217;s once
handsome suit of blue.</p>
<p>As he worked they talked of the best means
of securing an interview with Margaret, for Jan
readily guessed that Peter would forbid it, and
it was finally decided that Snorro should take
her a letter, as soon as Peter was at the store
next day. There was a little cave by the seaside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
half way between the town and Peter&#8217;s
house, and there Jan was to wait for Snorro&#8217;s
report.</p>
<p>In the meantime Peter had reached his
home. In these days it was a very quiet,
somber place. Thora was in ill health, in much
worse health than any one but herself suspected,
and Margaret was very unhappy. This
evening Thora had gone early to bed, and
Margaret sat with her baby in her arms. When
her father entered she laid him in the cradle.
Peter did not like to have it in any way forced
upon his notice, and Margaret understood well
enough that the child was only tolerated for
her sake. So, without any of those little fond
obtrusive ways so natural to a young mother,
she put the child out of the way, and sat down
to serve her father&#8217;s tea.</p>
<p>His face was dark and angry, his heart felt
hard to her at that hour. She had brought so
much sorrow and shame on him. She had been
the occasion of so many words and acts of
which he was ashamed. In fact, his conscience
was troubling him, and he was trying to lay
the whole blame of his cruelty and injustice on
her. For some time he did not speak, and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
was too much occupied with her own thoughts
to ask him any questions. At length he
snapped out, &#8220;Jan Vedder came back to Lerwick
yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said yesterday. Did thou think he would
run here to see thee the first moment? Not
he. He was at Tulloch&#8217;s last night. He will
have been at Torr&#8217;s all day, no doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret&#8217;s eyes filled with tears, and Peter
looked angrily at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Art thou crying again? Now listen, thou
art not like to see him at all. He has thrown
thy £600 to the bottom of the sea&mdash;ship, cargo,
and crew, all gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan? Father, is Jan safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is safe enough. The devil holds his
own from water. Now, if he does come to see
thee, thou shalt not speak with him. That is
my command to thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret answered not, but there was a look
upon her face, which he understood to mean
rebellion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring me the Bible here.&#8221; Then as he
turned to the place he wanted, he said: &#8220;Now,
Margaret, if thou art thinking to disobey thy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
father, I want thee to hear in what kind of
company thou wilt do so;&#8221; and he slowly
read aloud:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Backbiters&mdash;haters of God&mdash;despiteful&mdash;proud&mdash;boasters&mdash;inventors
of evil things&mdash;<i>disobedient
to parents</i>;&#8217; dost thou hear, Margaret?
&#8216;<i>disobedient to parents</i>&mdash;without understanding&mdash;covenant
breakers&mdash;without natural affection&mdash;implacable&mdash;unmerciful.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see him once, father? Let me see
him for half an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for one moment. Disobey me if thou
dares.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is my husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am thy father. Thy obligation to me
began with thy birth, twenty years before thou
saw Jan Vedder. Between man and wife there
may be a divorce, between father and daughter
there can be no bill of separation. The tie of
thy obedience is for life, unless thou wilt take
the risk of disobeying thy God. Very well,
then, I say to thee, thou shalt not speak to Jan
Vedder again, until he has proved himself
worthy to have the care of a good woman.
That is all I say, but mind it! If thou disobey
me, I will never speak to thee again. I will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
send thee and thy child from my sight, I will
leave every penny I have to my two nephews,
Magnus and Thorkel. That is enough. Where
is thy mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is in pain, and has gone to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a sick house, I think. First, thou wert
like to die, and ever since thy mother hath been
ill; that also is Jan Vedder&#8217;s doing, since thou
must needs fret thyself into a fever for him.&#8221;
Then he took his candle and went to his sick
wife, for he thought it best not to weaken his
commands by any discussion concerning
them.</p>
<p>Margaret did what most mothers would have
done, she lifted her child for consolation. It
was a beautiful child, and she loved it with an
idolatrous affection. It had already taught her
some lessons strange enough to Margaret Vedder.
For its sake she had become conciliating,
humble, patient; had repressed her feelings of
mother-pride, and for the future good of her
boy, kept him in a corner as it were. She had
never suffered him to be troublesome, never
intruded him upon the notice of the grandfather
whom some day doubtless he would completely
conquer. Ah, if she had only been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
half as unselfish with Jan! Only half as prudent
for Jan&#8217;s welfare!</p>
<p>She lifted the boy and held him to her
breast. As she watched him, her face grew
lovely. &#8220;My child!&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;for
thee I can thole every thing. For thy sake, I
will be patient. Nothing shall tempt me to
spoil thy life. Thou shalt be rich, little one,
and some day thee and I will be happy together.
Thy father robbed thee, but I will not
injure thee; no, indeed, I will not!&#8221;</p>
<p>So, after all, Jan&#8217;s child was to be the barrier
between him and his wife. If Jan had chosen
to go back to the class from which she had
taken him, she would at least save her child
from the suffering and contempt of poverty.
What she would have done for his father, she
would do for him. Yes, that night she fully
determined to stand by her son. It might be
a pleasure for her to see Jan, and even to be
reconciled to him, but she would not sacrifice
her child&#8217;s inheritance for her own gratification.
She really thought she was consummating a
grand act of self-denial, and wept a few pitiful
tears over her own hard lot.</p>
<p>In the morning Peter was unusually kind to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
her. He noticed the baby, and even allowed her
to lay it in his arms while she brought him his
seal-skin cloak and woolen mufflers. It was a
dangerous advance for Peter; he felt his heart
strangely moved by the sleeping child, and he
could not avoid kissing him as he gave him
back to his mother. Margaret smiled at her
father in her deep joy, and said softly to him,
&#8220;Now thou hast kissed me twice.&#8221; Nothing
that Peter could have done would have so
bound her to him. He had sealed his command
with that kiss, and though no word of
promise was given him, he went to his store
comparatively light-hearted; he was certain his
daughter would not disobey him.</p>
<p>While this scene was transpiring, one far
more pathetic was taking place in Snorro&#8217;s
room. Jan&#8217;s clothes had been washed and
mended, and he was dressing himself with an
anxious desire to look well in his wife&#8217;s eyes
that was almost pitiful. Snorro sat watching
him. Two women could hardly have been
more interested in a toilet, or tried harder to
make the most out of poor and small materials.
Then Jan left his letter to Margaret with
Snorro, and went to the cave agreed upon, to
await the answer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>Very soon after Peter reached the store,
Snorro left it. Peter saw him go, and he suspected
his errand, but he knew the question had
to be met and settled, and he felt almost sure
of Margaret that morning. At any rate, she
would have to decide, and the sooner the
better. Margaret saw Snorro coming, but she
never associated the visit with Jan. She
thought her father had forgotten something
and sent Snorro for it. So when he knocked,
she said instantly, &#8220;Come in, Michael Snorro.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first thing Snorro saw was the child.
He went straight to the cradle and looked at
it. Then he kneeled down, gently lifted the
small hand outside the coverlet, and kissed it.
When he rose up, his face was so full of love
and delight that Margaret almost forgave him
every thing. &#8220;How beautiful he is,&#8221; he whispered,
looking back at the sleeping babe.</p>
<p>Margaret smiled; she was well pleased at
Snorro&#8217;s genuine admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he is so like Jan&mdash;only Jan is still
more beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret did not answer him. She was
washing the china cups, and she stood at the
table with a towel over her arm. Snorro
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
thought her more beautiful than she had been
on her wedding day. During her illness, most
of her hair had been cut off, and now a small
white cap covered her head, the short, pale-brown
curls just falling beneath it on her brow
and on her neck. A long, dark dress, a white
apron, and a white lawn kerchief pinned over
her bosom, completed her attire. But no lady
in silk or lace ever looked half so womanly.
Snorro stood gazing at her, until she said,
&#8220;Well, then, what hast thou come for?&#8221;</p>
<p>With an imploring gesture he offered her
Jan&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p>She took it in her hand and turned it over,
and over, and over. Then, with a troubled face,
she handed it back to Snorro.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no, read it! Oh, do thou read it!
Jan begs thee to read it! No, no, I will not
take it back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare not read it, Snorro. It is too
late&mdash;too late. Tell Jan he must not come
here. It will make more sorrow for me. If
he loves me at all, he will not come. He is
not kind to force me to say these words. Tell
him I will not, dare not, see him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is thou that art unkind. He has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
shipwrecked, Margaret Vedder; bruised and
cut, and nearly tossed to death by the waves.
He is broken-hearted about thee. He loves
thee, oh, as no woman ever deserved to be
loved. He is thy husband. Thou wilt see
him, oh yes, thou wilt see him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not see him, Snorro. My father hath
forbid me. If I see Jan, he will turn me and
the child from the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him. Go to thy husband and thy own
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband hath no home for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For thou pulled it to pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away, Snorro, lest worse words come.
I will not sacrifice that little innocent babe for
Jan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Jan&#8217;s son&mdash;thou art ruining Jan&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, wilt thou go, Michael Snorro, and
tell Jan that I say what my father says: when
he is worthy of me I will come to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go, but I will tell thee first, that Jan
will be worthy of thee long before thou art
worthy of him.&#8221; Then, ere Margaret could
prevent him, he walked to the cradle, lifted the
child, and kissed it again and again, saying
between each kiss, &#8220;That is for thy father,
little one.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>The child was crying when he laid it down,
and Margaret again angrily ordered him to
leave the house. Before she had soothed it to
peace, Snorro was nearly out of sight. Then
Thora, who had heard the dispute, rose from
her bed and came into the room. She looked
ill and sad, and asked faintly, &#8220;What is this
message sent to Jan Vedder? He will not
believe it. Look for him here very soon, and
be sure what thou doest is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father told me what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet ask thy heart and thy conscience also.
It is so easy for a woman to go wrong, Margaret;
it is almost impossible for her to put
wrong right. Many a tear shall she wash it
out with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done no wrong to Jan. Dost thou
think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When one gets near the grave, Margaret,
there is a little light from beyond, and many
things are seen not seen before. Oh, be sure
thou art right about Jan! No one can judge
for thee. Fear not to do what thy heart says,
for at the end right will come right, and wrong
will come wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a solemn stillness after this conversation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
Thora sat bent over beside the fire
musing. Margaret, wearied with the feelings
which her interview with Snorro had called
forth, rested upon the sofa; she was suffering,
and the silence and melancholy of her mother
seemed almost a wrong to her. It was almost
as if she had taken Jan&#8217;s part.</p>
<p>A knock at the door startled both women.
Thora rose and opened it. It was Jan.
&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want to see my wife
and child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret, speak for thyself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare not see Jan. Tell him so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thora repeated the message.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask Margaret if that is her last word to
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mechanically Thora asked the question, and
after an agonizing pause Margaret gasped out,
&#8220;Yes, yes&mdash;until&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask her to stand a moment at the window
with the child. I long to see them.&#8221; Then he
turned to go to the window, and Thora shut
the door. But it was little use repeating Jan&#8217;s
request, Margaret had fainted, and lay like one
dead, and Thora forgot every thing till life
returned to her daughter. Then as the apparent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
unkindness was irrevocable and unexplainable,
she said nothing of it. Why should she add
to the sorrow Margaret was suffering?</p>
<p>And as for Jan, the universal opinion was
that he ought to suffer. He had forfeited his
wife, and his home, and his good name, and he
had lost his boat. When a man has calamity
upon calamity the world generally concludes
that he must be a very wicked man to deserve
them. Perhaps the world is right; but it is
also just possible that the world, even with its
six thousand years of gathered wisdom, may
be wrong.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />THE MAN AT DEATH&#8217;S DOOR.</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent6'>&#8220;Thoughts hardly to be packed</p>
<p class='indent6'>Into a narrow act,</p>
<p>Fancies that broke through language and escaped,</p>
<p class='indent6'>All I could never be,</p>
<p class='indent6'>All men ignored in me,</p>
<p>This I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher shaped.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>It must be remembered, however, that Margaret
was bound by ties whose strength
this generation can hardly conceive. The
authority of a father over a child in England
and Scotland is still a very decided one.
Fifty years ago in Shetland it was almost absolute.
Margaret believed the fifth commandment
to be as binding upon her as the first.
From her childhood it had been pointed out
to her as leading all the six defining our duty
to our fellow-creatures. Therefore if she
thought her father&#8217;s orders regarding Jan
unkind, the possibility of disobeying them
never presented itself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>Jan&#8217;s troubles were pointed out to her as the
obvious results of Jan&#8217;s sins. How could he
expect a blessing on a boat bought as he had
bought The Solan? And what was the use of
helping a man who was always so unfortunate?
If Peter did not regard misfortune as a sin, he
drew away from it as if it were something even
worse. Sometimes God blesses a man through
poverty, sometimes through riches, but until
the rod blossoms even good Christians call it a
chastening rod. Margaret had a dread of
making her child share Jan&#8217;s evil destiny:
perhaps she was afraid of it for herself. Self
is such an omnipresent god, that it is easy to
worship him in the dark, and to obey
him almost unconsciously. When Margaret
recovered from her faint, she was inclined to
think she deserved praise for what she called
her self-denial. She knew also that her father
would be satisfied with her conduct, and Peter&#8217;s
satisfaction took tangible forms. He had
given her £100 when she broke up her home
and left Jan; she certainly looked for some
money equivalent for her present obedience.
And yet she was quite positive this latter consideration
had in no way at all influenced her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
decision; she was sure of that; only, there could
be no harm in reflecting that a duty done
would have its reward.</p>
<p>As for Jan, he let people say whatever they
chose to say about him. To Tulloch and to
Michael Snorro he described the tempest, and
the desperation with which he had fought for
his boat and his life; but defended himself to
no one else. Day after day he passed in the
retreat which Snorro had made him, and lying
there he could plainly hear the men in
Peter&#8217;s store talk about him. Often he met
the same men in Torr&#8217;s at night, and he laughed
bitterly to himself at their double tongues.
There are few natures that would have been
improved by such a discipline; to a man who
had lost all faith in himself, it was a moral
suicide.</p>
<p>Down, down, down, with the rapidity with
which fine men go to ruin, went Jan. Every little
thing seemed to help him to the bottom; yes,
even such a trifle as his shabby clothes. But
shabby clothes were not a trifle to Jan. There are
men as well as women who put on respectability
with respectable raiment; Jan was of that class.
He was meanly dressed and he felt mean, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
had no money to buy a new suit. All Snorro&#8217;s
small savings he had used long before for one
purpose or another, and his wages were barely
sufficient to buy food, and to pay Jan&#8217;s bill at
Torr&#8217;s; for, alas! Jan would go to Torr&#8217;s.
Snorro was in a sore strait about it, but if
Torr&#8217;s bill were not paid, then Jan would go to
Inkster&#8217;s, a resort of the lowest and most suspicious
characters. Between the two evils he
chose the lesser.</p>
<p>And Jan said in the freedom of Torr&#8217;s many
things which he ought not to have said: many
hard and foolish things, which were repeated
and lost nothing by the process. Some of
them referred to his wife&#8217;s cruelty, and to
Peter Fae&#8217;s interference in his domestic concerns.
That he should talk of Margaret at all
in such a place was a great wrong. Peter took
care that she knew it in its full enormity; and
it is needless to say, she felt keenly the insult
of being made the subject of discussion among
the sailor husbands who gathered in Ragon
Torr&#8217;s kitchen. Put a loving, emotional man
like Jan Vedder in such domestic circumstances,
add to them almost hopeless poverty and
social disgrace, and any one could predict with
apparent certainty his final ruin.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>Of course Jan, in spite of his bravado of indifference,
suffered very much. He had fits of
remorse which frightened Snorro. Under
their influence he often wandered off for two
or three days, and Snorro endured during them
all the agonies of a woman who has lost her
child.</p>
<p>One night, after a long tramp in the wind
and snow, he found himself near Peter Fae&#8217;s
house, and a great longing came over him to
see his wife and child. He knew that Peter
was likely to be at home and that all the doors
were shut. There was a bright light in the
sitting-room, and the curtains were undrawn.
He climbed the inclosure and stood beside the
window. He could see the whole room plainly.
Peter was asleep in his chair on the hearth.
Thora sitting opposite him, was, in her slow
quiet way, crimping with her fingers the lawn
ruffles on the newly ironed clothes. Margaret,
with his son in her arms, walked about the
room, softly singing the child to sleep. He
knew the words of the lullaby&mdash;an old Finnish
song that he had heard many a mother sing.
He could follow every word of it in Margaret&#8217;s
soft, clear voice; and, oh, how nobly fair, how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
calmly good and far apart from him she
seemed!</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Sleep on, sleep on, sweet bird of the meadow!</p>
<p class='indent2'>Take thy rest, little Redbreast.</p>
<p>Sleep stands at the door and says,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The son of sleep stands at the door and says,</p>
<p>Is there not a little child here?</p>
<p class='indent2'>Lying asleep in the cradle?</p>
<p>A little child wrapped up in swaddling clothes,</p>
<p class='indent2'>A child reposing under a coverlet of wool?&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Jan watched the scene until he could endure
the heart-torture no longer. Had he not been
so shabby, so ragged, so weather-stained, he
would have forced his way to his wife&#8217;s presence.
But on such apparently insignificant
trifles hang generally the great events of life.
He could not bear the thought of this fair,
calm, spotless woman seeing him in such a
plight. He went back to Snorro, and was very
cross and unreasonable with him, as he had
been many times before. But Snorro was one
of those rare, noble souls, who can do great and
hopeless things, and continue to love what they
have seen fall.</p>
<p>He not only pitied and excused Jan, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
would not suffer any one to wrong, or insult
him. All Torr&#8217;s regular visitors feared the big
man with the white, stern face, who so often
called for Jan Vedder, and who generally took
his friend away with him. Any thing that is
genuine commands respect, and Snorro&#8217;s love
for Jan was so true, so tender, and unselfish,
that the rudest soul recognized his purity.
Even in Peter&#8217;s store, and among the better
class who frequented it, his honest affection
was not without its result.</p>
<p>Jan usually avoided the neighborhood when
Peter was there, but one afternoon, being half
intoxicated, he went rolling past, singing
snatches of &#8220;The Foula Reel.&#8221; He was ragged
and reckless, but through every disadvantage,
still strikingly handsome. Michael Snorro
lifted himself from the barrel which he was
packing, and stood watching Jan with a face
full of an inexpressible sorrow. Some one
made a remark, which he did not hear, but he
heard the low scornful laugh which followed it,
and he saw Peter Fae, with a smile of contempt,
walk to the door, and glance up the
street after Jan.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing I know,&#8221; said Snorro, looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
angrily at the group, &#8220;all of you have laughed
in a very great company, for when a good man
takes the road to hell, there also laughs the
devil and all his angels. Yes, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was as if a thunderbolt had fallen among
them. Peter turned to his books, and one by one
the men left the store, and Jan Vedder&#8217;s name
was not spoken again before Snorro by any one.</p>
<p>During the fishing season Jan went now and
then to sea, but he had no regular engagement.
Some said he was too unreliable; others, more
honest, acknowledged they were superstitious
about him. &#8220;Sooner or later ill luck comes
with him,&#8221; said Neil Scarpa. &#8220;I would as lief
tread on the tongs, or meet a cat when going
fishing as have Jan Vedder in my boat,&#8221; said
John Halcro. This feeling against him was
worse than shipwreck. It drove Jan to despair.
After a night of hard drinking, the idea of suicide
began to present itself, with a frightful
persistence. What was there for him but a
life of dislike and contempt, or a swift unregretted
<ins title='Removed extra quote'>death.</ins></p>
<p>For it must be considered that in those days
the ends of the earth had not been brought
together. Emigration is an idea that hardly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
enters a Shetlander&#8217;s mind at the present time;
then it was a thing unknown. There were no
societies for information, or for assistance.
Every man relied upon his own resources, and
Jan had none. He was in reality, a soul made
for great adventures, condemned to fight life
in the very narrowest lists.</p>
<p>When the warm weather came, he watched
for Margaret, and made many attempts to see
her. But she had all the persistence of narrow
minds. She had satisfied herself that her duty
to her father and to her son was before all
other duties, and no cruelty is so cruel as that
which attacks its victims from behind the ramparts
of Duty and Conscience.</p>
<p>Thora frequently saw Jan, and he pleaded
his cause eloquently to her. She was very
sorry for him, and at times also very angry
with him. She could not understand how
Margaret&#8217;s treatment should have taken all the
heart and purpose out of his life. She would
not let him say so; it was like casting the
blame of all his idleness and dissipation upon
her daughter. She would make no effort
towards a reconciliation; while Margaret
held him in such small estimation, she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
sure that there could be no permanence in one,
even if it could be effected.</p>
<p>Yet once or twice she spoke to Margaret in
Jan&#8217;s favor. If Margaret had desired to disobey
her father, and see her husband, Thora&#8217;s
sympathies would have been with her; but no
mother likes to put herself in a position which
will give her child an opportunity of answering
her with a look of reproachful astonishment.
Something very like this had met her suggestion
that &#8220;Jan must love his child, and long to
see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret was almost angry at such a supposition.
&#8220;Jan love his child! It was impossible!
No man who did so, would behave as
Jan had done, and was still doing. To encourage
Jan in any way was to disobey her father,
and throw herself and her child upon Jan&#8217;s
mercies. She knew what they were. Even if
she could see it to be her duty to sacrifice herself,
on no account would she sacrifice the babe
who had only her to think and care for him.
She would do nothing in any way to prejudice
its future.&#8221; This was the tenor of her constant
conversation. It was stated anew every morning,
it was reiterated every hour of the day;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
and with every day&#8217;s reiteration, she became
more certain of her own wisdom and justice.</p>
<p>One night, after another useless effort to see
his wife, Jan went to Torr&#8217;s, and found Hol
Skager there. Jan was in a reckless mood, and
the thought of a quarrel was pleasant to him.
Skager was inclined to humor him. They had
many old grievances to go over, and neither of
them picked their words. At length Jan
struck Skager across the mouth, and Skager
instantly drew his knife.</p>
<p>In a moment Torr and others had separated
the men. Skager was persuaded to leave the
house, and Jan, partly by force and partly by
entreaty, detained. Skager was to sail at midnight,
and Torr was determined that Jan should
not leave the house until that hour was passed.
Long before it, he appeared to have forgotten
the quarrel, to be indeed too intoxicated to
remember any thing. Torr was satisfied, but
his daughter Suneva was not.</p>
<p>About ten o&#8217;clock, Snorro, sitting in the back
door of the store, saw Suneva coming swiftly
towards him. Ere he could speak she said,
&#8220;Skager and Jan have quarreled and knives
have been drawn. If thou knowest where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
Skager is at anchor, run there, for I tell thee,
there was more of murder than liquor in Jan&#8217;s
eyes this night. My father thought to detain
him, but he hath slipped away, and thou may
be sure he has gone to find Skager.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snorro only said, &#8220;Thou art a good woman,
Suneva.&#8221; He thought he knew Skager&#8217;s harbor;
but when he got there, neither boat nor
man was to be seen. Skager&#8217;s other ground
was two miles in an opposite direction under
the Troll Rock, and not far from Peter Fae&#8217;s
house. Snorro hastened there at his utmost
speed. He was in time to see Skager&#8217;s boat,
half a mile out at sea, sailing southward.
Snorro&#8217;s mental processes were slow. He stood
still to consider, and as he mused, the solemn
stillness of the lonely place was broken by a
low cry of pain. It was Jan&#8217;s voice. Among
a thousand voices Snorro would have known it.
In a few moments he had found Jan, prone
upon the cliff edge bleeding from a wound in
his side.</p>
<p>He was still sensible and he smiled at Snorro,
saying slowly, &#8220;Thou must not be sorry. It is
best so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most fishermen know something of the treatment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
of a knife wound; Snorro staunched the
blood-flow, as well as he was able, and then
with gigantic strides went to Peter Fae&#8217;s.
Margaret sat spinning beside her baby&#8217;s cradle,
Peter had gone to bed, Thora dozed at the fireside.</p>
<p>The impatience of his knock and voice
alarmed the women, but when Margaret heard
it was Snorro&#8217;s voice, she quickly unfastened
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the store burning?&#8221; she asked angrily,
&#8220;that thou comest in such hot haste?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thy husband has been murdered. Take
thou water and brandy, and go as quick as thou
canst run to the Troll&#8217;s Rock. He lies there.
I am going for the doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did thou come here, Michael Snorro?
Ever art thou a messenger of ill. I will not go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go thou at once, or I will give thee a name
thou wilt shudder to hear. I will give it to thee
at kirk, or market, or wherever I meet thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snorro fled to the town, almost in uttering
the words, and Thora, who had at once risen to
get the water and the brandy, put them into her
daughter&#8217;s hands. &#8220;There is no time now for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
talking. I will tell thy father and send him
after thee. Shall we have blood on our souls?
All of us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what shall I do? What shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Art thou a woman? I tell thee, haste.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare not&mdash;oh, my child! I will wake
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I command thee to go&mdash;this moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, almost in a passion, Margaret went.
The office of mercy had been forced upon her.
She had not been permitted to consider her
own or her child&#8217;s interest. No one had thought
of her feelings in the matter. When she
reached Jan&#8217;s side she was still indignant at the
peremptory way in which she had been treated.</p>
<p>He felt her there, rather than saw her&mdash;&#8220;<i>Margaret!</i>&#8221;
he said feebly, &#8220;<i>Margaret! At last!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered in bitter anger, &#8220;at
last. Hast thou called me to see thy shameful
end? A name full of disgrace thou leaves to
me and to thy son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me&mdash;I am sorry. Forgive!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not forgive thee. No woman injured
as I have been, can forgive.&#8221;</p>
<p>His helplessness did not touch her. Her own
wrongs and the wrongs of her child filled her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
heart. She was determined that at this hour
he should at least understand their full enormity,
and she spoke with all the rapid bitterness
of a slow, cold nature, wrought up to an
unnatural passion. In justifying herself she
forgot quite that she had been sent to succor
him until help arrived. She was turning away
when Jan, in a voice full of misery, uttered one
word:</p>
<p>&#8220;Water!&#8221;</p>
<p>Something womanly in her responded to the
pitiful, helpless cry. She went back, and kneeling
by his side, put the bottle to his mouth.
The touch of his head upon her arm stirred her
strangely; ere she let it slip from her hold, he
had fainted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Jan! Jan! Jan! My husband! My
husband! Oh Jan, dear, forgive me! Jan, I am
here! It is thy Margaret! I still love thee!
Yes, indeed, I love thee!&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was too late. There was no response.
She looked in horror and terror at the white
face at her feet. Then she fled back to the
house for help. Whether her father liked it or
not, Jan must now be brought there. In that
last moment she had forgiven him every thing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
All the love of her betrothal had come like a
great wave over her heart. &#8220;Poor Jan! Poor
Jan!&#8221; she sobbed, as she fled like a deer across
the moor.</p>
<p>Peter had been roused and had reluctantly
dressed himself. In such an hour of extremity
he would have to give the wounded man shelter
if he were brought there. But he tarried as
long as possible, hoping that Snorro would
remove Jan and take him into the town. To
be roused from sleep to confront such a problem
of duty was a very unpleasant affair, and Peter
was sulkily tying his shoe-strings when Margaret,
breathless and sobbing, returned for
him.</p>
<p>Her impetuosity and her emotion quite mastered
him. She compelled him to go with her
to Jan. But when they reached the Troll
Rock Jan had disappeared. There was nothing
there but the blue sailor&#8217;s cap which he had
worn. No human being was in sight. Any
party of relief brought by Snorro could be seen
for a mile. Margaret picked up the cap, and
gazed at it in a maze of anguish. Only one
thing could have happened. During her
absence consciousness had returned to Jan,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
and he, poor soul, remembering her cruel words,
and seeing that she had left him there alone to
die, had purposely edged himself over the cliff.
The sea was twenty feet deep below it. She
put her hands before her eyes, and shrieked
until the welkin rang with her shrill, piercing
cries. Peter could do nothing with her, she
would not listen to him, and finally she became
so frantically hysterical that he was alarmed
for her life and reason, and had little opportunity
that night to make any inquiries about
his troublesome son-in-law.</p>
<p>Now, when God will help a man, he hath his
own messenger. That night, Doctor Balloch sat
in the open door of his house. This door was
at the end of a little jetty to which his skiff was
tied; and the whole expanse of the beautiful
bay was before him. It was covered with
boats, idly drifting about under the exquisite
sky. Light ripples of laughter, and sweet
echoes of song upon the waters, drifted toward
him. He had read his evening portion, and he
sat watching the flickering lights of the changing
aurora. The portion had been the Nineteenth
Psalm, and he was wishing that the
Sweet Singer of Israel, who thought the Judean
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
heavens &#8220;declared the glory of God,&#8221; could
have seen the Shetland skies.</p>
<p>Suddenly, and peremptorily, a voice encompassed
him&mdash;a soft, penetrating voice, that came
like the wind, he knew not how or whence,
&#8220;Take thy boat and go to the Troll Rock.&#8221;
He rose at once and went to the end of the
jetty. The sea, darkly blue, was smooth as
glass, the air clear, the majestic headlands
imparting to the scene a solemn cathedral
grandeur. He strove to shake off the strange
impression, but it grew stronger and more imperative,
and he said softly, as if answering
some one, &#8220;I will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He returned to the house and called his
servant Hamish. Hamish and he lived alone,
and had done so for more than thirty years,
and they thoroughly trusted each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Untie the boat, Hamish. We are going for
a row. We will go as far as Troll Rock.&#8221;</p>
<p>This rock projected over the sea, which
flowed into a large cave under it; a cave which
had long been a favorite hiding place for smuggled
cargoes. But when the minister reached
it, all was silence. Hamish looked at his master
curiously. What could he mean by resting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
on his oars and watching so desolate and dangerous
a place? Very soon both were aware of
a human voice; the confused, passionate echoes
of Margaret&#8217;s above them; and these had not
long ceased when Jan Vedder fell from the
rock into the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;This man is to be saved, Hamish; it is what
we have come for.&#8221; Hamish quietly slipped
into the water, and when Jan, speechless and
insensible, rose to the surface, he caught him
with one arm and swam with him to the boat.
In another moment he was in the bottom of it,
and when he came to himself, his wound had
been dressed, and he was in the minister&#8217;s own
bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, thou wilt do well enough, Jan, only
thou must keep quiet body and mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell no one I am here. Thou wilt do that
for me? Yes, thou wilt. Let them think I am
at the bottom of the Troll Rock&mdash;for God&#8217;s
sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell no one, Jan. Thou art safe here;
be at perfect rest about that matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course the minister thought Jan had committed
some crime. It was natural for every
one to suspect Jan of doing wrong. But the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
fact that he had been sent so obviously to save
him was, in the doctor&#8217;s mind, an evidence of
the divine interest in the youth which he was
glad to share. He had been appointed his
preserver, and already he loved him. He fully
trusted Hamish, but he thought it well to say
to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;We will speak to no one of our row to the
Troll Rock, Hamish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Hamish ever talk, master?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thou art a wise man; but here there is
more to guide than I yet understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look nor word of mine shall hinder it.&#8221;</p>
<p>For four days the doctor stayed near Jan,
and never left his house. &#8220;I will be quiet and
let the news find me,&#8221; he thought. It came
into the manse kitchen in various forms. Hamish
received every version of the story with
that grave shake of the head which fits so admirably
every requirement of sympathy. &#8220;It
was all a great pity,&#8221; was his most lengthy
comment; but then Hamish never exceeded
half a dozen words on any subject.</p>
<p>On the fourth evening, which was Saturday,
Peter Fae sent this message to the minister:
&#8220;Wilt thou come down to my store for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
good of a wretched soul?&#8221; It was then
getting late, and Peter stood in his shop-door
alone. He pointed to Michael Snorro, who sat
in a corner on some seal-skins in a stupor of
grief.</p>
<p>&#8220;He hath neither eaten nor slept since. It
is pitiful. Thou knowest he never had too
much sense&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know very clever men who are fools, besides
Michael Snorro. Go thy ways home. I
will do what I can for him&mdash;only, it had been
kinder, had thou sent for me ere this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went to Snorro and sat down beside him.
&#8220;Thou wilt let me speak to thee, Snorro. I
come in God&#8217;s name. Is it Jan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is Jan. My Jan, my Jan, my friend!
the only one that ever loved me. Jan! Jan!
Jan!&#8221; He said the last words in an intense
whisper. It seemed as if his heart would break
with each.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Jan&#8217;s loss all thy grief, Snorro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, there is more. Has thou found it
out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. Speak to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare not speak it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is as sinful to think it. I am thy true
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
friend. I come to comfort thee. Speak to me,
Snorro.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he lifted his face. It was overspread by
an expression of the greatest awe and sorrow:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is also my Lord Christ. He hath deceived
me. He said to me, whatsoever ye shall
ask in my name, that will I do. I asked him
always, every hour to take care of Jan. If I
was packing the eggs, or loading the boats, or
eating my dinner, my heart was always praying.
When Jan was at sea, I asked, &#8216;take care
of him,&#8217; when he was at Torr&#8217;s, I prayed then
the more, &#8216;dear Lord Christ, take care of him.&#8217;
I was praying for him that night, <i>at the very
hour he perished</i>. I can pray no more now.
What shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Art thou sure thou prayed for the right
thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said, &#8216;whatsoever.&#8217; Well, then, I took
him at his word. Oh yes, I believed every
word he said. At the last, I thought, he will
surely save Jan. I will pray till his time comes.
He will not deceive a poor soul like me, for he
knows right well that Snorro loves him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so thou thinkest that Christ Jesus who
died for thee hath deceived thee?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, he hath forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, nay, Snorro. He never forgets.
Behold he has graven thy name upon his hands.
Not on the mountains, for they shall depart;
not on the sun, for it shall grow dark; not on
the skies, for they shall melt with fervent heat;
but on <i>his own hand</i>, Snorro. Now come with
me, and I will show thee, whether Lord Christ
heard thee praying or not, and I will tell thee
how he sent me, his servant always, to answer
thy prayer. I tell thee at the end of all this
thou shalt surely say: &#8216;there hath not failed
one word of all his good promise, which he
promised.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he lifted Michael&#8217;s cap and gave it to
him, and they locked the store door, and in
silence they walked together to the manse. For
a few minutes he left Snorro alone in the study.
There was a large picture in it of Christ upon
the cross. Michael had never dreamed of such
a picture. When the minister came back he
found him standing before it, with clasped
hands and streaming eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can thou trust him, Michael?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unto death, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, tread gently. He sleeps.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>Wondering and somewhat awestruck Michael
followed the doctor into the room where Jan
lay. One swift look from the bed to the smiling
face of Jan&#8217;s saviour was all Michael
needed. He clasped his hands above his head,
and fell upon his knees, and when the doctor
saw the rapture in his face, he understood the
transfiguration, and how this mortal might put
on immortality.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />DEATH AND CHANGE.</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Wield thine own arm!&mdash;the only way</p>
<p>To know life is by living.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>When Jan awoke Snorro was standing
motionless beside him. He feebly
stretched out his hand, and pulled him close,
closer, until his face was on the pillow beside
his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Jan, how could&#8217;st thou? My heart
hath been nearly broken for thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all well now, Snorro. I am going to a
new life. I have buried the old one below the
Troll Rock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until the following night the men remained
together. They had much to talk of, much
that related both to the past and the future.
Jan was particularly anxious that no one should
know that his life had been saved: &#8220;And
mind thou tell not my wife, Snorro,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
&#8220;Let her think herself a widow; that will
please her best of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There might come a time when it would be
right to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not think it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She might be going to marry again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;Yes, that is possible&mdash;well
then, in that case, thou shalt go to the
minister; he will tell thee what to do, or he
himself will do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She might weep sorely for thee, so that she
were like to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mock me not, Snorro. She will not weep
for me. Well then, let me pass out of memory,
until I can return with honor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where wilt thou go to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou remember that yacht that was
tied to the minister&#8217;s jetty four weeks ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that her owner stayed at the manse
for two days?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I saw him. What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will be back again, in a week, in a few
days, perhaps to-morrow. He is an English
lord, and a friend of the minister&#8217;s. I shall go
away with him. There is to be a new life for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
me&mdash;another road to take; it must be a better
one than that in which I have stumbled along
for the last few years. Thou art glad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Jan, I am glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If things should happen so that I can send
for thee, wilt thou come to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to the end of the world I will come.
Thee only do I love. My life is broken in two
without thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every day Snorro watched the minister&#8217;s
jetty, hoping, yet fearing, to see the yacht
which was to carry Jan away. Every night
when the town was asleep, he went to the
manse to sit with his friend. At length one
morning, three weeks after Jan&#8217;s disappearance,
he saw the minister and the English lord enter
Peter&#8217;s store together. His heart turned sick
and heavy; he felt that the hour of parting was
near.</p>
<p>Peter was to send some eggs and smoked
geese on board the yacht, and the minister
said meaningly to Snorro, &#8220;Be sure thou puts
them on board this afternoon, for the yacht sails
southward on the midnight tide.&#8221; Snorro understood
the message. When the store was closed
he made a bundle of Jan&#8217;s few clothes; he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
washed and mended them all. With them he
put the only sovereign he possessed, and his
own dearly-loved copy of the Gospels. He
thought, &#8220;for my sake he may open them, and
then what a comfort they will be sure to give
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was in Snorro&#8217;s arms Jan was carried on
board at the very last moment. Lord Lynne
had given him a berth in the cabin, and he
spoke very kindly to Snorro. &#8220;I have heard,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;that there is great love between you
two. Keep your heart easy, my good fellow; I
will see that no harm comes to your friend.&#8221;
And the grateful look on Snorro&#8217;s face so
touched him that he followed him to the deck
and reiterated the promise.</p>
<p>It was at the last a silent and rapid parting.
Snorro could not speak. He laid Jan in his
berth, and covered him as tenderly as a mother
would cover her sick infant. Then he kissed
him, and walked away. Dr. Balloch, who
watched the scene, felt the deep pathos and
affection that had no visible expression but in
Snorro&#8217;s troubled eyes and dropped head; and
Lord Lynne pressed his hand as a last assurance
that he would remember his promise <ins title='Was concern'>concerning</ins>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
Jan&#8217;s welfare. Then the anchor was lifted, and
the yacht on the tide-top went dancing southward
before the breeze.</p>
<p>At the manse door the minister said, &#8220;God
be thy consolation, Snorro! Is there any
thing I, his servant, can do for thee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, thou can let me see that picture
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of the Crucified?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I need.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took a candle from Hamish and led him
into the study. In the dim light, the pallid,
outstretched figure and the divine uplifted face
had a sad and awful reality. Even upon the
cultivated mind and heart, fine pictures have a
profound effect; on this simple soul, who never
before had seen any thing to aid his imagination
of Christ&#8217;s love, the effect was far more
potent. Snorro stood before it a few minutes
full of a holy love and reverence, then, innocently
as a child might have done, he lifted up
his face and kissed the pierced feet.</p>
<p>Dr. Balloch was strangely moved and troubled.
He walked to the window with a prayer on his
lips, but almost immediately returned, and
touching Snorro, said&mdash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Take the picture with thee, Snorro. It is
thine. Thou hast bought it with that kiss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But thou art weeping!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I can not love as thou dost. Take
what I have freely given, and go. Ere long the
boats will be in and the town astir. Thou hast
some room to hang it in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a room in which no foot but mine
will tread till Jan comes back again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And thou wilt say no word of Jan. He
must be cut loose from the past awhile. His
old life must not be a drag upon his new one.
We must give him a fair chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou knows well I am Jan&#8217;s friend to the
uttermost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever of comfort Snorro found in the
pictured Christ, he sorely needed it. Life had
become a blank to him. There was his work,
certainly, and he did it faithfully, but even
Peter saw a great change in the man. He no
longer cared to listen to the gossip of the store,
he no longer cared to converse with any one.
When there was nothing for him to do, he sat
down in some quiet corner, buried his head in
his hands, and gave himself up to thought.</p>
<p>Peter also fancied that he shrank from him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
and the idea annoyed him; for Peter had begun
to be sensible of a most decided change in the
tone of public opinion regarding himself. It
had come slowly, but he could trace and feel it.
One morning when he and Tulloch would have
met on the narrow street, Tulloch, to avoid
the meeting, turned deliberately around and
retraced his steps. Day by day fewer of the
best citizens came to pass their vacant hours in
his store. People spoke to him with more
ceremony, and far less kindness.</p>
<p>He was standing at his store door one afternoon,
and he saw a group of four or five men
stop Snorro and say something to him. Snorro
flew into a rage. Peter knew it by his attitude,
and by the passionate tones of his
voice. He was vexed at him. Just at this
time he was trying his very best to be conciliating
to all, and Snorro was undoubtedly saying
words he would, in some measure, be held
accountable for.</p>
<p>When he passed Peter at the store door, his
eyes were still blazing with anger, and his
usually white face was a vivid scarlet. Peter
followed him in, and asked sternly, &#8220;Is it not
enough that I must bear thy ill-temper? Who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
wert thou talking about? That evil Jan Vedder,
I know thou wert!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were talking of thee, if thou must
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What wert thou saying? Tell me; if thou
wilt not, I will ask John Scarpa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wert well not to ask. Keep thy
tongue still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is some ill-feeling toward me. It
hath been growing this long while. Is it thy
whispering against me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask Tulloch why he would not meet thee?
Ask John Scarpa what Suneva Glumm said last
night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Little need for me to do that, since thou
can tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snorro spoke not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snorro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, master.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many years hast thou been with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou knows I came to thee a little lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who had neither home nor friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I been a just master to thee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou hast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou, too, hast been a just and faithful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
servant. I have trusted thee with every thing.
All has been under thy thumb. I locked not
gold from thee. I counted not after thee. I
have had full confidence in thee. Well, then, it
seems that my good name is also in thy hands.
Now, if thou doest thy duty, thou wilt tell me
what Tulloch said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said thou had been the ruin of a better
man than thyself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning Jan Vedder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was whom he meant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Suneva Glumm say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, last night, when the kitchen was
full, they were talking of poor Jan; and Suneva&mdash;thou
knowest she is a widow now and gone
back to her father&#8217;s house&mdash;Suneva, she strode
up to the table, and she struck her hand upon
it, and said, &#8216;Jan was a fisherman, and it is
little of men you fishers are, not to make
inquiry about his death. Here is the matter,&#8217;
she said. &#8216;Snorro finds him wounded, and
Snorro goes to Peter Fae&#8217;s and sends Jan&#8217;s wife
to her husband. Margaret Vedder says she
saw him alive and gave him water, and went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
back for Peter Fae. Then Jan disappears, and
when Snorro gets back with a doctor and four
other men, there is no Jan to be <ins title='Added quote'>found.&#8217;</ins> I say
that Margaret Vedder or Peter Fae know what
came of Jan, one, or both of them, know. But
because the body has not been found, there
hath been no inquest, and his mates let him go
out of life like a stone dropped into the sea,
and no more about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They told thee that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, they did; and John Scarpa said thou
had long hated Jan, and he did believe thou
would rather lose Jan&#8217;s life than save it. Yes,
indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And thou?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said some angry words for thee. Ill thou
hast been to Jan, cruel and unjust, but thou did
not murder him. I do not think thou would do
that, even though thou wert sure no man would
know it. If I had believed thou hurt a hair of
Jan&#8217;s head, I would not be thy servant to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou judgest right of me, Snorro. I
harmed not Jan. I never saw him. I did not
want him brought to my house, and therefore
I made no haste to go and help him; but I hurt
not a hair of his head.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I will maintain that every where, and to all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do they think came of Jan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What else, but that he was pushed over the
cliff-edge? A very little push would put him
in the sea, and the under-currents between here
and the Vor Ness might carry the body far
from this shore. All think that he hath been
drowned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Peter turned away and sat down, silent
and greatly distressed. A new and terrible
suspicion had entered his mind with Snorro&#8217;s
words. He was quite sure of his own innocence,
but had Margaret pushed Jan over? From her
own words it was evident she had been angry
and hard with him. Was this the cause of the
frantic despair he had witnessed. It struck him
then that Margaret&#8217;s mother had ever been cold
and silent, and almost resentful about the matter.
She had refused to talk of it. Her whole
behavior had been suspicious. He sat brooding
over the thought, sick at heart with the sin and
shame it involved, until Snorro said&mdash;&#8220;It is
time to shut the door.&#8221; Then he put on his
cloak and went home.</p>
<p>Home! How changed his home had become!
It was a place of silence and unconfessed sorrow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
All its old calm restfulness had gone.
Very soon after Jan&#8217;s disappearance, Thora had
taken to her bed, and she had never left it
since. Peter recognized that she was dying,
and this night he missed her sorely. Her quiet
love and silent sympathy had been for many a
year a tower of strength to him. But he could
not carry this trouble to her, still less did he
care to say any thing to Margaret. For the
first time he was sensible of a feeling of irritation
in her presence. Her white despairing
face angered him. For all this trouble, in one
way or another, she was responsible.</p>
<p>He felt, too, that full of anxiety as he was,
she was hardly listening to a word he said.
Her ears were strained to catch the first movement
of her child, who was sleeping in the next
room. To every one he had suddenly become
of small importance. Both at home and
abroad he felt this. To such bitter reflections
he smoked his pipe, while Margaret softly sung
to her babe, and Thora, with closed eyes, lay
slowly breathing her life away: already so far
from this world, that Peter felt as if it would
be cruel selfishness to trouble her more with its
wrongs and its anxieties.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>Four days afterward, Thora said to her
daughter: &#8220;Margaret, I had a token early this
morning. I saw a glorious ship come sailing
toward me. Her sails were whiter than snow
under the moonshine; and at her bow stood
my boy, Willie, my eldest boy, and he smiled
and beckoned me. I shall go away with the
next tide. Ere I go, thou tell me something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever thou ask me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What came of poor Jan Vedder?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Margaret understood the shadow that
had fallen between herself and her mother;
the chill which had repressed all conversation;
the silent terror which had perchance hastened
death.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mother!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;did thou really
have this fear? I never harmed Jan. I left
him on the cliff. God knows I speak the truth.
I know no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God! Now I can go in peace.&#8221;
Margaret had fallen on her knees by the bedside,
and Thora leaned forward and kissed
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I send for father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will come in time.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>A few hours afterward she said in a voice
already far away, as if she had called back from
a long distance, &#8220;When Jan returns be thou
kinder to him, Margaret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he come back? Mother, tell me!&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was no answer to the yearning
cry. Never another word from the soul that
had now cast earth behind it. Peter came
home early, and stood gloomily and sorrowfully
beside his companion. Just when the tide
turned, he saw a momentary light flash over
the still face, a thrill of joyful recognition, a
sigh of peace, instantly followed by the pallor,
and chill, and loneliness of death.</p>
<p>At the last the end had come suddenly.
Peter had certainly known that his wife was
dying, but he had not dreamed of her slipping
off her mortal vesture so rapidly. He was
shocked to find how much of his own life would
go with her. Nothing could ever be again just
as it had been. It troubled him also that there
had been no stranger present. The minister
ought to have been sent for, and some two or
three of Thora&#8217;s old acquaintances. There
was fresh food for suspicion in Thora Fae being
allowed to pass out of life just at this time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
with none but her husband and daughter near,
and without the consolation of religious rites.</p>
<p>Peter asked Margaret angrily, why she had
neglected to send for friends and for the
minister?</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother was no worse when thou went to
the store this morning. About noon she fell
asleep, and knew nothing afterward. It would
have been cruel to disturb her.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in her own heart Margaret was conscious
that under any circumstances she would
have shrunk from bringing strangers into the
house. Since Jan&#8217;s disappearance, she had
been but once to kirk, for that once had been
an ordeal most painful and humiliating. None
of her old friends had spoken to her; many
had even pointedly ignored her. Women excel
in that negative punishment which they deal
out to any sister whom they conceive to have
deserved it. In a score of ways Margaret
Vedder had been made to feel that she was
under a ban of disgrace and suspicion.</p>
<p>Some of this humiliation had not escaped
Peter&#8217;s keen observation; but at the time he
had regarded it as a part of the ill-will which
he also was consciously suffering from, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
which he was shrewd enough to associate with
the mystery surrounding the fate of his son-in-law.
Connecting it with what Snorro had said,
he took it for further proof against his daughter.
Thora&#8217;s silence and evident desire to
be left to herself, were also corroborative.
Did Thora also suspect her? Was Margaret
afraid to bring the minister, lest at the last
Thora might say something? For the same
reason, had Thora&#8217;s old intimates been kept
away? Sometimes the dying reveal things
unconsciously; was Margaret afraid of this?
When once suspicion is aroused, every thing
feeds it. Twenty-four hours after the first
doubt had entered Peter&#8217;s heart, he had almost
convinced himself that Margaret was responsible
for Jan&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>He remembered then the stories in the
Sagas of the fair, fierce women of Margaret&#8217;s
race. A few centuries previously they had
ruled things with a high hand, and had seldom
scrupled to murder the husbands who did not
realize their expectations. He knew something
of Margaret&#8217;s feelings by his own; her
wounded self-esteem, her mortification at Jan&#8217;s
failures, her anger at her poverty and loss of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
money, her contempt for her own position. If
she had been a man, he could almost have
excused her for killing Jan; that is, if she had
done it in fair fight. But crimes which are
unwomanly in their nature shock the hardest
heart, and it was unwomanly to kill the man
she had loved and chosen, and the father of her
child; it was, above all, a cowardly, base deed
to thrust a wounded man out of life. He tried
to believe his daughter incapable of such a
deed, but there were many hours in which he
thought the very worst of her.</p>
<p>Margaret had no idea that her father nursed
such suspicions; she felt only the change and
separation between them. Her mother&#8217;s doubt
had been a cruel blow to her; she had never
been able to speak of it to her father. That
he shared it, never occurred to her. She was
wrapped up in her own sorrow and shame, and
at the bottom of her heart inclined to blame
her father for much of the trouble between her
and Jan. If he had dealt fairly with Jan after
the first summer&#8217;s fishing, Jan would never
have been with Skager. And how eager he
had been to break up her home! After all,
Jan had been the injured man; he ought to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
have had some of her tocher down. A little
ready money would have made him satisfied
and happy; her life and happiness had been
sacrificed to her father&#8217;s avarice. She was sure
now that if the years could be called back, she
would be on Jan&#8217;s side with all her heart.</p>
<p>Two souls living under the same roof and
nursing such thoughts against each other were
not likely to be happy. If they had ever come
to open recrimination, things uncertain might
have been explained; but, for the most part,
there was only silence in Peter&#8217;s house. Hour
after hour, he sat at the fireside, and never
spoke to Margaret. She grew almost hysterical
under the spell of this irresponsive trouble.
Perhaps she understood then why Jan had fled
to Torr&#8217;s kitchen to escape her own similar
exhibitions of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>As the months wore on, things in the store
gradually resumed their normal condition.
Jan was dead, Peter was living, the tide of popular
feeling turned again. Undoubtedly, however,
it was directed by the minister&#8217;s positive,
almost angry, refusal to ask Peter before the
kirk session to explain his connection with
Jan&#8217;s disappearance. He had never gone much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
to Peter&#8217;s store, but for a time he showed his
conviction of Peter&#8217;s innocence by going every
day to sit with him. It was supposed, of course,
that he had talked the affair thoroughly over
with Peter, and Peter did try at various times
to introduce the subject. But every such
attempt was met by a refusal in some sort on
the minister&#8217;s part. Once only he listened to
his complaint of the public injustice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou can not control the wind, Peter,&#8221; he
said in reply; &#8220;stoop and let it pass over thee.
I believe and am sure thy hands are clear of
Jan&#8217;s blood. As to how far thou art otherwise
guilty concerning him, that is between God and
thy conscience. But let me say, if I were
asked to call thee before the kirk session on
the count of unkindness and injustice, I would
not feel it to be my duty to refuse to do so.&#8221;
Having said this much, he put the matter out
of their conversation; but still such a visible
human support in his dark hour was a great
comfort to Peter.</p>
<p>It was a long and dreary winter. It is
amazing how long time can be when Sorrow
counts the hours. Sameness, too, adds to
grief; there was nothing to vary the days.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
Margaret went to bed every night full of that
despairing oppression which hopes nothing
from the morrow. Even when the spring came
again her life had the same uniform gray tinge.
Peter had his fisheries to look forward to, and
by the end of May he had apparently quite
recovered himself. Then he began to be a
little more pleasant and talkative to his daughter.
He asked himself why he should any
longer let the wraith of Jan Vedder trouble his
life? At the last he had gone to help him; if
he were not there to be helped, that was not his
fault. As for Margaret, he knew nothing positively
against her. Her grief and amazement
had seemed genuine at the time; very likely it
was; at any rate, it was better to bury forever
the memory of a man so inimical to the peace
and happiness of the Faes.</p>
<p>The fishing season helped him to carry out
this resolution. His hands were full. His
store was crowded. There were a hundred
things that only Peter could do for the fishers.
Jan was quite forgotten in the press and
hurry of a busier season than Lerwick had ever
seen. Peter was again the old bustling, consequential
potentate, the most popular man in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
the town, and the most necessary. He cared
little that Tulloch still refused to meet him; he
only smiled when Suneva Glumm refused to
let him weigh her tea and sugar, and waited
for Michael Snorro.</p>
<p>Perhaps Suneva&#8217;s disdain did annoy him a
little. No man likes to be scorned by a good
and a pretty woman. It certainly recurred to
Peter&#8217;s mind more often than seemed necessary,
and made him for a moment shrug his
shoulders impatiently, and mutter a word or
two to himself.</p>
<p>One lovely moonlight night, when the boats
were all at sea, and the town nearly deserted,
Peter took his pipe and rambled out for a walk.
He was longing for some womanly sympathy,
and had gone home with several little matters
on his heart to talk over with Margaret. But
unfortunately the child had a feverish cold, and
how could she patiently listen to fishermen&#8217;s
squabbles, and calculations of the various
&#8220;takes,&#8221; when her boy was fretful and suffering?
So Peter put on his bonnet, and with his
pipe in his mouth, rambled over the moor. He
had not gone far before he met Suneva Glumm.
Under ordinary circumstances he would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
let her pass him, but to-night he wanted to
talk, and even Suneva was welcome. He suddenly
determined &#8220;to have it out with her,&#8221;
and without ceremony he called to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me speak to thee, Suneva; I have something
to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned and faced him: &#8220;Well then, say
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have I done to get so much of thy
ill-will? I, that have been friends with thee
since I used to lift thee over the counter and
give thee a sweet lozenger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou did treat poor Jan Vedder so
badly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is Jan Vedder to thee, that thou
must lift his quarrel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was my friend, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And thy lover, perhaps. I have heard that
he loved thee before he ever saw my Margaret
when she was at school in Edinburgh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou hast heard lies then; but if he had
loved me and if I had been his wife, Jan had
been a good man this day; good and loving.
Yes, indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Art thou sure he is dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter Fae, if any one can answer that question,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
thou can; thou and thy daughter Margaret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard thou hast said this before
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I have said it often, and I think it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, listen to me, and see how thou
hast done me wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Peter pleaded his own cause, and he
pleaded it with such cleverness and eloquence
that Suneva quite acquitted him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe now thou art innocent,&#8221; she answered
calmly. &#8220;The minister told me so long
ago. I see now that he was right.&#8221; Then she
offered Peter her hand, and he felt so pleased
and grateful that he walked with her all the
way to the town. For Suneva had a great deal
of influence over the men who visited Torr&#8217;s,
and most of them did visit Torr&#8217;s. They
believed all she said. They knew her warm,
straightforward nature, and her great beauty
gave a kind of royal assurance to her words.</p>
<p>Peter was therefore well pleased that he had
secured her good will, and especially that he had
convinced her of his entire innocence regarding
Jan&#8217;s life. If the subject ever came up over the
fishers&#8217; glasses, she was a partisan worth having.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
He went home well satisfied with himself
for the politic stroke he had made, and with the
success which had attended it.</p>
<p>Margaret had seen her father talking and
walking with Suneva, and she was very much
offended at the circumstance. In her anger
she made a most imprudent remark&mdash;&#8220;My
mother not a year dead yet! Suneva is a bold,
bad woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What art thou thinking of? Let me tell
thee it was of Jan Vedder, and Jan Vedder
only, that we spoke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not until that moment had it struck Peter
that Suneva was a widow, and he a widower.
But the thought once entertained was one he
was not disposed to banish. He sat still half
an hour and recalled her bright eyes, and good,
cheerful face, and the pleasant confidential chat
they had had together. He felt comforted even
in the memory of the warm grip of her hand,
and her sensible, honorable opinions. Why
should he not marry again? He was in the
prime of life, and he was growing richer every
year. The more he thought of Suneva the
warmer his heart grew toward her.</p>
<p>He was not displeased when next day one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
his old comrades told him in a pawkie, meaning
way, that he had &#8220;seen him walking with Glumm&#8217;s
handsome widow.&#8221; A man nearly sixty is just
as ready to suppose himself fascinating as a man
of twenty. Peter had his courtiers, and they
soon found out that he liked to be twitted about
Suneva; in a little while a marriage between
the handsome widow and the rich merchant
was regarded as a very probable event.</p>
<p>When once the thought of love and marriage
has taken root in a man&#8217;s heart it grows
rapidly. The sight of Suneva became daily
more pleasant to Peter. Every time she came
to the store he liked her better. He took care
to let her see this, and he was satisfied to
observe that his attentions did not prevent her
visits.</p>
<p>In a few weeks he had quite made up his
mind; he was only watching for a favorable
opportunity to influence Suneva. In August,
at the Fisherman&#8217;s Foy, it came. Peter was
walking home one night, a little later than
usual, and he met Suneva upon the moor. His
face showed his satisfaction. &#8220;Long have I
watched for this hour,&#8221; he said; &#8220;now thou must
walk with me a little, for I have again some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
thing to say to thee. Where hast thou been,
Suneva?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I took charge of Widow Thorkel&#8217;s
knitting to sell it for her. She is bedridden,
thou knows. I got a good price for her,
and have been to carry her the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art a kind woman. Now, then, be
kind to me also. I want to have thee for my
wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What will thy daughter say to that? She
never liked me&mdash;nor have I much liked her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be long ere I ask my daughter if I
shall do this or that. It is thee I ask. Wilt
thou be my wife, Suneva?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would not be a bad thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a very good thing for me, and
for thee also. I should have thy pleasant face,
and thy good heart, and thy cheerful company
at my fireside. I will be to thee a loving husband.
I will give thee the house I live in, with
all its plenishing, and I will settle £70 a year on
thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is but a little thing for thee to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will make it a £100 a year. Now
what dost thou say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will marry thee, Peter, and I will do my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
duty to thee, and make thee happy.&#8221; Then
she put her hand in his, and he walked home
with her.</p>
<p>Next day all Lerwick knew that Peter was
going to marry Glumm&#8217;s handsome widow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />JAN AT HIS POST.</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem' style='width: 25em'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent18'>&#8220;Then like an embryo bird</p>
<p>One day, he knew not how, but God that morn</p>
<p>Had pricked his soul&mdash;he cracked his shelly case, and</p>
<p>Claimed his due portion in a larger life.</p>
<p>Into new life he starts, surveys the world</p>
<p>With bolder scope, and breathes more ample breath.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>With a great sigh of content Jan resigned
himself to rest when the parting was
over; and &#8220;The Lapwing,&#8221; with wind and tide
in her favor, went almost flying down the black
North Sea. The motion of the vessel and the
scent of the salt breeze were like his mother&#8217;s
lap and his native air. He had cast off his old
life like an old garment. Michael Snorro and
Dr. Balloch were the only memories of it he
desired to carry into his new one. But at the
first hour he could not even think of them.
He only wanted to sleep.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>Very soon sleep came to him, steeped him
from head to feet in forgetfulness, lulled him
fathoms deep below the tide of life and feeling.
It was after twelve the next noon when
he opened his eyes. Lord Lynne was sitting
at the cabin table just opposite his berth. It
took Jan two or three moments to remember
where he was, and during them Lord Lynne
looked up and smiled at him. Jan smiled
back a smile frank and trustful as a child&#8217;s. It
established his position at once. Lord Lynne
had been wondering what that position was to
be, and he had decided to let Jan&#8217;s unconscious
behavior settle it. Even an animal, or a bird,
that trusts us, wins us. The face that Jan
turned to Lord Lynne was just such a face as
he would have turned to Snorro&mdash;it trusted
every thing, it claimed every thing, and every
thing was given it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have had your health-sleep, Vedder;
I dare say you are hungry now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very hungry,&#8221; answered Jan. &#8220;Is it
breakfast time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean is it lunch time? You will have
to put two meals into one. Shall I order you
some fresh fish, and eggs, and a broiled bird?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The thought of them is good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And some roast mutton and potatoes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and plenty of tea if thou pleases.&#8221;</p>
<p>My lord had his lunch while Jan ate his
breakfast, and a very pleasant meal they made
of it. The yacht was tossing and pitching a
good deal, but they were leaving the islands
behind and sailing fast toward smoother waters
and brighter skies. Jan improved with every
hour&#8217;s flight, and he would gladly have left his
berth had Lord Lynne permitted it.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Aberdeen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you shall go on
shore, and see a physician. Dr. Balloch thinks
that he has treated you properly, but I promised
him to make sure of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decision at Aberdeen was highly favorable.
Jan was assured that he might be on
deck a few hours every day, with great advantage
to his health. They remained in Aberdeen
two days. On the second day a trunk bearing
his name was brought on board. Lord Lynne
was on shore at the time, but his valet had it
taken to Jan&#8217;s room and opened. It contained
a quantity of linen and clothing.</p>
<p>Jan had a love for good clothing. He felt
its influence, and without reasoning about the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
matter, felt that it influenced every one else.
When he had put on the linen, and a yachting
suit with its gilt buttons, and had knotted the
handkerchief at his neck, he felt that in all
eyes he was a different being from Vedder the
fisherman.</p>
<p>It would have been a difficult matter to Lord
Lynne to have given clothing to some men,
but Jan had not a vulgar feeling. He made
no protestations, no excuses, no promises of
repayment; he was not offensively demonstrative
in his gratitude. He took the gift, as
the gift had been given, with pleasure and confidence,
and he looked handsome and noble in
every thing he put on.</p>
<p>Lord Lynne was proud of him. He liked
to see his crew watch Jan. He encouraged his
valet to tell him what they said of him.
Every one had invented some romance about
the yacht&#8217;s visitor; no one supposed him to be
of less than noble birth. The cook had a
theory that he was some prince who had got
into trouble with his father. The secrecy with
which he had been brought on board at midnight,
his scarcely healed wound, the disguise
of a fisherman&#8217;s dress, were all regarded as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
positive proofs of some singular and romantic
adventure. On board &#8220;The Lapwing&#8221; Jan was
the central point of every man&#8217;s interest and
speculations.</p>
<p>And at this time, even Lord Lynne was a
little in the dark regarding Jan. Dr. Balloch
had only spoken of him as a young man going
to ruin for want of some friends. Incidentally
he had alluded to his matrimonial troubles,
and, one evening when they were walking, he
had pointed out Margaret Vedder. She was
standing on the Troll Rock looking seaward.
The level rays of the setting sun fell upon her.
She stood, as it were, in a glory; and Lord
Lynne had been much struck with her noble
figure and with the set melancholy of her fine
face.</p>
<p>So he knew that Jan had had trouble about
his wife, and also that he had been wounded in
a fight; and putting the two things together he
made a perfectly natural inference. He was
aware, also, that Margaret was Peter Fae&#8217;s
daughter and a probable heiress. If he
thought of Jan&#8217;s social position, he doubtless
considered that only a Shetland gentleman
would aspire to her hand. But he made no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
effort whatever to gain Jan&#8217;s confidence; if he
chose to give it, he would do so at the proper
time, and without it they were very happy.
For Lord Lynne had been a great traveler,
and Jan never wearied of hearing about the
places he had visited. With a map before him,
he would follow every step up and down
Europe. And across Asian seas, through Canadian
cities, and the great plains of the West,
the two men in memory and imagination went
together.</p>
<p>Nothing was said of Jan&#8217;s future; he asked
no questions, gave no hints, exhibited no anxiety.
He took his holiday in holiday spirit,
and Lord Lynne understood and appreciated
the unselfishness and the gentlemanly feeling
which dictated the apparent indifference. At
Margate the yacht went into harbor. Lord
Lynne expected letters there, which he said
would decide his movements for the winter.
He was silent and anxious when he landed; he
was in a mood of reckless but assumed indifference
when he came on board again.</p>
<p>After dinner he spread the large map on the
saloon table, and said: &#8220;Vedder, what do you
say to a few months&#8217; cruise in the Mediterranean?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
I am not wanted at home, and I should
like to show you some of the places we
have talked about. Suppose we touch at the
great Spanish ports, at Genoa, Venice, Naples
and Rome, and then break the winter among
the Isles of Greece and the old Ionian cities?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan&#8217;s face beamed with delight; there was no
need for him to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; continued his lordship, &#8220;as I sleep
a great deal in warm climates, I shall want a
good sailor aboard. I saw by the way you
handled the yacht during that breeze in &#8216;The
Wash,&#8217; that you are one. Will you be my
lieutenant this winter? I will pay you £100 a
quarter; that will keep you in pocket money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be a great deal of money to me,
and I shall be very glad to earn it so pleasantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that settles matters for a few months&mdash;when
we get back it will be time to buckle
to work. Heigh-ho! Lieutenant, head &#8216;The
Lapwing&#8217; for the Bay of Biscay, and we will
set our faces toward sunshine, and cast care
and useless regret behind our backs.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Gibraltar Lord Lynne evidently expected
letters, but they did not come. Every mail he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
was anxious and restless, every mail he was disappointed.
At length he seemed to relinquish
hope, and &#8216;The Lapwing&#8217; proceeded on her
voyage. One night they were drifting slowly
off the coast of Spain. The full moon shone
over a tranquil sea, and the wind blowing off
shore, filled the sails with the perfume of
orange blossoms. Lord Lynne had sent that
day a boat into Valencia, hoping for letters,
and had been again disappointed. As he
walked the deck with Jan in the moonlight, he
said sadly, &#8220;I feel much troubled to-night, Jan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since we were in Gibraltar I have seen
that thou hast some trouble, my lord. And
I am sorry for thee; my own heart is aching
to-night; for that reason I can feel for thy grief
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what trouble could come to a man
hid away from life in such a quiet corner of the
world as Shetland?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no corner too quiet, or too far
away, for a woman to make sorrow in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By every thing! You are right, Jan.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a few minutes&#8217; silence, and then
Jan said: &#8220;Shall I tell thee what trouble came
to me through a woman in Shetland?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I would like to hear about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Jan began. He spoke slowly and with
some hesitation at first. His youth was connected
with affairs about which the Shetlanders
always spoke cautiously. His father had been
one of the boldest and most successful of the
men who carried on that &#8220;French trade&#8221;
which the English law called smuggling. He
had made money easily, had spent it lavishly,
and at the last had gone to the bottom with his
ship, rather than suffer her to be taken. His
mother had not long survived her husband, but
there had been money enough left to educate
and provide for Jan until he reached manhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was ten years old when mother died,&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;and since then no one has really
loved me but Michael Snorro. I will tell thee
how our love began. One day I was on the
pier watching the loading of a boat. Snorro
was helping with her cargo, and the boys were
teasing him, because of his clumsy size and ugly
face. One of them took Snorro&#8217;s cap off his
head and flung it into the water. I was angry
at the coward, and flung him after it, nor would
I let him out of the water till he brought Snorro&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
cap with him. I shall never forget the
look Snorro gave me that hour. Ever since we
have been close friends. I will tell thee now
how he hath repaid me for that deed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Jan spoke of Margaret&#8217;s return from
school; of their meeting at one Fisherman&#8217;s
Foy, and of their wedding at the next. All of
Peter&#8217;s kindness and subsequent injustice; all
of Margaret&#8217;s goodness and cruelty, all of Snorro&#8217;s
affection and patience he told. He made
nothing better nor worse. His whole life, as
he knew and could understand it, he laid before
Lord Lynne.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so thou sees,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;how
little to blame and how much to blame I
have been. I have done wrong and I have
suffered. Yes, I suffer yet, for I love my wife
and she has cast me off. Dost thou think I
can ever be worthy of her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, Jan, that what you said is true&mdash;in
any corner of the earth where women are,
they can make men suffer. As to your worthiness,
I know not. There are some women
so good, that only the angels of heaven could
live with them. That £600 was a great mistake.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I think that now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan, life is strangely different and yet
strangely alike. My experience has not been
so very far apart from yours. I was induced
to marry when only twenty-one a lady who is
my inferior in rank, but who is a very rich
woman. She is a few years older than I, but
she is beautiful, full of generous impulses, and
well known for her charitable deeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are surely fortunate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very unhappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she not love thee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas! she loves me so much that she makes
both her own and my life miserable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I do not understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her love is a great love, but it is a selfish
love. She is willing that I should be happy in
her way, but in no other. I must give her not
only my affection, but my will, my tastes, my
duties to every other creature. My friends,
horses, dogs, even this yacht, she regards as
enemies; she is sure that every one of them
takes the thought and attention she ought to
have. And the hardest part is, that her noble
side only is seen by the world. I alone suffer
from the fault that spoils all. Consequently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
the world pities her, and looks upon me very
much as the people of Lerwick looked on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And can thou do nothing for thy own
side?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I am in the case of a very worthy
old Roman lord who desired to divorce his wife.
There was a great outcry. All his friends were
amazed. &#8216;Is she not handsome, virtuous, rich,
amiable?&#8217; they asked. &#8216;What hath she done
to thee?&#8217; The Roman husband pointed to his
sandal. &#8216;Is it not new, is it not handsome and
well made? But none of you can tell where it
pinches me.&#8217; That old Roman and I are brothers.
Every one praises &#8216;my good wife, my rich
wife, my handsome wife,&#8217; but for all that, the
matrimonial shoe pinches me.&#8221;</p>
<p>This confidence brought the two men near
together. Henceforward there was no lack of
conversation. While every other subject fails,
a domestic grievance is always new. It can be
looked at in so many ways. It has touched us
on every side of our nature. We are never
quite sure where we have been right, and where
wrong. So Lord Lynne and Jan talked of
&#8216;My Lady&#8217; in Lynnton Castle, and of Margaret
Vedder in her Shetland home, but the conversations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
were not in the main unkind ones. Very
early in them Lynne told Jan how he had once
seen his wife standing on the Troll Rock at sunset,
&#8220;lovely, and grand, and melancholy, as some
forsaken goddess in her desolated shrine.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were sitting at the time among the
ruins of a temple to Pallas. The sun was setting
over Lydian waters, and Jan seemed to see
in the amber rays a vision of the tall, fair
woman of his love and dreams. She ruled him
yet. From the lonely islands of that forlorn
sea she called him. Not continents nor oceans
could sever the mystical tie between them. On
the sands close by, some young Greek girls were
dancing to a pipe. They were beautiful, and
the dance was picturesque, but Jan hardly
noticed them. The home-love was busy in his
heart. &#8220;Until death us part.&#8221; Nothing is
more certain, in a life of such uncertainty.</p>
<p>Amid the loveliest scenes of earth they passed
the winter months. It was far on in May when
they touched Gibraltar on their return. Letters
for both were waiting there. For Jan a
short one from Dr. Balloch, and a long one
from Michael Snorro. He was sitting with
Snorro&#8217;s in his hand when Lord Lynne, bright
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
and cheerful, came out of his cabin. &#8220;I have
very fair news, Jan; what has the mail brought
you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seldom it comes for nothing. I have heard
that my mother-in-law is dead. She was ever
my friend, and I am so much the poorer. Peter
Fae too is in trouble; he is in trouble about
me. Wilt thou believe that the people of Lerwick
think he may have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Murdered you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, just that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have often thought that the suspicion
would be a natural one. Has he been arrested?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no; but he is in bad esteem. Some
speak not to him. The minister, though, he
stands by him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is enough. If Dr. Balloch thought it
necessary, he would say sufficient to keep Peter
Fae out of danger. A little popular disapproval
will do him good. He will understand then
how you felt when wife and friends looked
coldly on you, and suspicion whispered things to
injure you that no one dared to say openly.
Let Peter suffer a little. I am not sorry for
him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Once he liked me, and was kind to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are now going straight to Margate. I
am promised office, and shall probably be a
busy public man soon. It is time also that you
buckled down to your work. We have had our
holiday and grown strong in it&mdash;every way
strong. What next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou speak first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, Jan, men must work if they
would be rich, or even respectable. What work
have you thought of?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only of the sea. She is my father and my
mother and my inheritance. Working on land,
I am as much out of place as a fish out of
water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are right. Will you join the
Merchant Service, or do you think better of
the Royal Navy? I have a great deal of
influence with the Admiralty Lords, and I have
often wished I could be a &#8216;blue jacket&#8217; myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Above all things, I would like the Royal
Navy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you shall be a &#8216;blue jacket;&#8217; that is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
quite settled and well settled, I am sure. But
every moment will take time, and it will probably
be winter before I can get you a post on any
squadron likely to see active service. During
the interval I will leave &#8216;The Lapwing&#8217; in your
care, and you must employ the time in studying
the technical part of your profession. I
know an old captain in Margate who will teach
you all he knows, and that is all that any of
them know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan was very grateful. The prospect was a
pleasant one and the actual experience of it
more than fulfilled all his expectations. &#8220;The
Lapwing&#8221; was his home and his study. For he
soon discovered how ignorant he was. Instruction
in naval warfare was not all he needed.
Very soon the old captain was supplemented
by the schoolmaster. The days were too short
for all Jan wished to learn. He grudged the
hours that were spent in sleep. So busy was
he that he never noticed the lapse of time, or,
if he did, it was only that he might urge himself
to greater efforts.</p>
<p>It did not trouble him that Lord Lynne
seldom wrote, and never came. His salary was
promptly paid, and Jan was one of the kind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
of men whom good fortune loves. He did
not worry over events. He did not keep
wondering what she was going to do for
him, or wish night and day that she would
make haste with the next step in his behalf.
He took gratefully and happily the good he
had, and enjoyed it to the utmost.</p>
<p>When a change came it was the first week in
November. A lovely afternoon had not
tempted Jan from his books. Suddenly the
cabin door was darkened; he lifted his head,
and saw Lord Lynne regarding him with a
face full of pleasure. He came rapidly forward
and turned over the volumes on the table
with great interest. &#8220;I am glad to see these
books, Jan,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Arithmetic, Geography,
History, French&mdash;very good, indeed! And your
last letter delighted me. The writing was
excellent. Her Majesty&#8217;s officers ought to be
educated gentlemen; and you are now one of
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan looked up, with eager, inquiring face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; you are now Lieutenant Jan Vedder,
of Her Majesty&#8217;s Schooner Retribution.
You are to sail for the African coast within a
week. Jan, I congratulate you!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>Jan rose and put out both hands. The action
was full of feeling. No words could have been
so eloquent. It was worth an hour of words,
and Lord Lynne so understood it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I called at the mail as I came through the
town, here is a letter for you. While you read
it I will go through the yacht.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he returned Jan was walking anxiously
about with the letter in his hand. &#8220;Has
bad news come with the good, Jan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know not if it be bad or if it be good.
Peter Fae hath married again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the new wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I know her. She was ever a good
friend to me, but my wife liked her not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she young or old, pretty or otherwise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Few women are so handsome, and she has
not yet thirty years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it is likely Peter Fae has found a
master?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That, too, is likely. Snorro says that he
hath settled on her the house in which he lives,
with much money beside. Perhaps now my
Margaret will be poor. I can not think that
she will live with Suneva. What then will she
do? I wish to see her very much.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That you can not possibly do, Lieutenant
Vedder. You will be under orders in the
morning. To leave your post now, would be
desertion. I do not fear for your wife. She
knows very well how to look after her own
interests. The two women in Peter&#8217;s house
will be Greek against Greek, and your wife will
certainly win some victories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not have her suffer, my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will not suffer. It is likely I may be
in Lerwick next summer; I will see to that.
Have you saved any thing of your salary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have spent very little of it. I have now
over £300.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I advise you to send £200 to Dr.
Balloch for her. Tell him if help is needed to
give it. He will understand the wisest way in
which it can be offered. If it is not needed,
he can save it toward that £600.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can send £300.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can not. Uniforms must be
bought, and fees must be paid, and there are
numerous other expenses to meet. Now you
must pack your clothes and books. To-morrow
you must be in Portsmouth; there &#8216;The Retribution&#8217;
is waiting for you and for orders. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
orders may arrive at any hour, and it is possible
you may have to sail at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next afternoon Jan was in Portsmouth.
It was a wonderful thing for him to tread the
deck of his own ship; a handsome, fast-sailing
schooner, specially built for the African blockade.
She carried a heavy pivot gun and a
carronade, and had a crew of fifty officers and
men. He could scarcely believe that he was
to command her, even when his officers saluted
him. In three days he was to sail, and there
was much to be done in the interval. But the
hurry and bustle was an advantage; he had no
time to feel the strangeness of his position;
and men soon get accustomed to honor. On
the third day he filled his place with the easy
nonchalance of long authority.</p>
<p>It was fortunate for Jan that the mission on
which he was sent was one that stirred him to
the very depths of his nature. In the seclusion
and ignorance of his life in Shetland, he
had heard nothing of the wrongs and horrors
of slavery. It is doubtful if there had ever
come into his mind, as a distant idea, the
thought of a race of men who were as black as
he was white. Therefore when Lord Lynne
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
explained to him the cruelty and wickedness
of the slave traffic, Jan heard him at first with
amazement, then with indignation. That passionate
love of freedom and that hatred of
injustice, which are at the foundation of the
Norse character, were touched at every point.
The tears of pity, the fire of vengeance, were
in his eyes. To chase a slaver, to punish her
villainous owners, to liberate her captives!
Jan took in the whole grand duty at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you are pleased with your prospects,
Jan. Many would not be. The duty of the
African blockading squadron is very hard; it is
not a favorite station. That fact made your
appointment so easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one thing could make my prospects
brighter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Snorro could go with me! How he
would rejoice in such work! He is so strong;
when he is angry, he is as strong as six men, I
think. Once I saw him put a sick fisherman
behind his back, and compel the boat crew to
give him his share. Yes, indeed! They looked
in Snorro&#8217;s face, and did what he said without
a word. He would fly on these men-catchers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
like a lion. He would stamp them under his
feet. It is a war that would make Snorro&#8217;s
heart glad. He would slay the foe as he would
pour out water, and for the weak and suffering
he would lay down his life. He would,
indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan spoke rapidly, and with enthusiasm.
Lord Lynne looked at him with admiration, as
he said: &#8220;It is too late now to send for Snorro.
How you do love that man, Jan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, he deserves it. I would be a
cur if I loved him not. I love thee, too.
Thou saved me from myself; thou hast given
to me like a prince; but as for Snorro! He
gave me all he had! Thou art not grieved?
Thou wilt not think me ungrateful for thy
goodness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had forgotten Snorro, Jan, I would
not have trusted you for myself. You do right
to love him. When the squadron is recalled
he must be sent for. It is not right to part
you two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell him what thou says. It will
make him happy. Snorro is one of those men
who can wait patiently.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Jan wrote to Snorro. He took the largest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
official paper he could find, and he sealed the
letter with the ship&#8217;s seal, sparing not the
sealing-wax in its office. For he knew well
what an effect the imposing missive would
have. In the hurry of his own affairs he could
think of such small things, for the sake of the
satisfaction which they would give to his
simple-minded friend.</p>
<p>But mails were long at that time of the
year in reaching Shetland. Jan was far down
the African coast when his letter came to
Lerwick. It was under cover to Dr. Balloch,
and though the day was rough and snowy the
good minister found his way to Peter&#8217;s store.
He was always welcome there. Peter never
forgot how faithfully he stood by him when
the darkest suspicions kept other men away,
and Snorro associated his visits with news from
Jan. When, therefore, the minister in leaving
said, &#8220;Snorro thou art strong, and Hamish is
weak, come to-night and carry him some peats
into the house,&#8221; Snorro&#8217;s face lighted up with
expectation.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly it was a great night for Snorro.
When Dr. Balloch explained to him, as Lord
Lynne had explained to Jan, the noble necessity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
of the African squadron, his heart burned
like fire. He could almost have shouted aloud
in his pity and indignation. It seemed to him
a glorious thing that Jan had gone. Somehow
his limited capacity failed to take in more than
the work to be done, and that Jan was to do it.
Minor details made no impression on him. Jan
to his mind was the only hero. The British
Government, Wilberforce, public opinion, all
the persons and events that had led up to
England&#8217;s advocacy of the rights of humanity,
all were merged in Jan.</p>
<p>When he left Dr. Balloch he felt as if he
were walking upon air. On the moor, where
no one could hear him, he laughed aloud, a
mighty laugh, that said for Jan far more than
he could find words to say. He heeded not
the wind and the softly falling snow; had not
Jan, his Jan, sailed away in her Majesty&#8217;s
service, a deliverer and a conqueror? Suddenly
he felt a desire to see something relating to
him. If he went round by Peter&#8217;s house,
perhaps he might see Margaret and the baby.
In the state of exaltation he was in, all things
seemed easy and natural to him. In fact the
slight resistance of the elements was an unconscious
and natural relief.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>Peter&#8217;s house shone brightly afar off. As he
approached it he saw that the sitting-room was
in a glow of fire and candle-light. Before he
reached the gate he heard the murmur of
voices. He had only to stand still and the
whole scene was before him. Peter sat in his
old place on the hearthstone. Around it were
two of Suneva&#8217;s cousins, soncy, jolly wives,
with their knitting in their hands and their
husbands by their sides. They were in eager
and animated conversation, noisy laughs and
ejaculations could be distinctly heard, and
Suneva herself was moving busily about, setting
the table for a hot supper. Her blue silk
dress and gold chain, and her lace cap fluttering
with white ribbons, made her a pleasant woman
to look at. It was a happy household picture,
but Margaret Vedder was not in it.</p>
<p>Snorro waited long in hopes of seeing her;
waited until the smoking goose and hot potatoes,
and boiling water, lemons and brandy,
drew every one to the white, glittering table.
He felt sure then that Margaret would join the
party, but she did not. Was it a slight to her?
That Margaret Vedder personally should be
slighted affected him not, but that Jan&#8217;s wife
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
was neglected, that made him angry. He
turned away, and in turning glanced upward.
There was a dim light in a corner room up
stairs. He felt sure that there Margaret was
sitting, watching Jan&#8217;s boy. He loitered round
until he heard the moving of chairs and the
bustle incident to the leave-taking of guests.
No access of light and no movement in Margaret&#8217;s
room had taken place. She had made
no sign, and no one remembered her. But
never had Snorro felt so able to forgive her as
at that hour.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br /><br />SWEET HOME.</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent18'>&#8220;On so nice a pivot turns</p>
<p>True wisdom; here an inch, or there, we swerve</p>
<p>From the just balance; by too much we sin,</p>
<p>And half our errors are but truths unpruned.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>If Margaret were neglected, it was in the
main her own fault; or, at least, the fault of
circumstances which she would not even try to
control. Between her and Suneva there had
never been peace, and she did not even wish
that there should be. When they were scarcely
six years old, there was rivalry between them
as to which was the better and quicker knitter.
During their school days, this rivalry had found
many other sources from which to draw
strength. When Margaret consented to go to
Edinburgh to finish her education, she had felt
that in doing so she would gain a distinct
triumph over Suneva Torr. When she came
back with metropolitan dresses, and sundry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
trophies in the way of Poonah painting and
Berlin wool work, she held herself above and
aloof from all her old companions, and especially
Suneva.</p>
<p>Her conquest of Jan Vedder, the admiration
and hope of all the young girls on the Island,
was really a victory over Suneva, to whom Jan
had paid particular attention before he met
Margaret. Suneva had been the bitterest drop
in all her humiliation concerning her marriage
troubles. In her secret heart she believed
Suneva had done her best to draw her old lover
from his quiet home to the stir and excitement
of her father&#8217;s drinking-room. If Peter had
searched Shetland through, he could not have
found a second wife so thoroughly offensive to
his daughter.</p>
<p>And apart from these personal grievances,
there were pecuniary ones which touched Margaret&#8217;s
keenest sensibilities. Peter Fae&#8217;s house
had long been to her a source of pride; and,
considering all things, it was admirably
arranged and handsomely furnished. In the
course of events, she naturally expected that it
would become her house&mdash;hers and her boy&#8217;s.
To not only lose it herself, but to have it given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
to Suneva without reservation, seemed to Margaret
not only a wrong but an insult. And the
£100 a year which had been given with it, was
also to her mind a piece of cruel injustice.
She could not help reflecting that some such
kindness to her at her own wedding would
have satisfied Jan, and perhaps altered their
whole life. It must be admitted that her
mortification in being only a dependent in the
house which she had ruled, and regarded as
her own, was a natural and a bitter one.</p>
<p>At the last, too, the change had come upon
her with the suddenness of a blow from behind.
It is true that Peter made no secret of his
courtship, and equally true that the gossips of
the town brought very regular news of its
progress to Margaret. But she did not believe
her father would take a step involving so much
to them both, without speaking to her about
it. As soon as he did so, she had resolved to
ask him to prepare her own home for her
without delay. She had taken every care of
her furniture. It was in perfect order, and as
soon as the house had been again put into
cleanly shape, she could remove to it. The
thought of its perfect isolation, and of its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
independence, began to appear desirable to her.
Day by day she was getting little articles ready
which she would need for her own housekeeping.</p>
<p>In the meantime the summer with all its
busy interests kept Peter constantly at the
store. When he was at home, his mind was so
full of &#8220;fish takes&#8221; and of &#8220;curing,&#8221; that Margaret
knew that it would be both imprudent
and useless to name her private affairs. Perhaps
his extreme preoccupation was partly
affected in order to avoid the discussion of
unpleasant matters; but if so, Margaret never
suspected it. She had many faults, but she
was honest and truthful in all her ways, and she
believed her father would be equally so with
her. When the fishing was over, Peter was
always a few weeks employed in counting up
his expenses and his gains. October and part
of November had been from her girlhood
regarded as a critical time; a time when on no
account he was to be troubled about household
matters. But when November was nearly
over, then Margaret determined to open the
subject of the reported marriage to him, if he
did not take the initiative.</p>
<p>As it was getting near this time, she walked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
over one afternoon to her old home, in order to
ascertain its condition. Never, since she so
foolishly abandoned it, had she been near the
place. Its mournful, desolate aspect shocked
her. Peter had never been able to rent it.
There was an idea that it belonged to Margaret
and was &#8220;unlucky.&#8221; The gate had fallen from
the rusted hinges. Passing boys had maliciously
broken the windows, and the storms of
two winters had drifted through the empty
rooms. Timber is scarce and dear in Shetland,
and all the conveniences for her animals and
fowls had been gradually plundered and carried
off. Margaret looked with dismay at the
place, and, as she went through the silent
rooms, could not help a low cry of real heart
pain. In them it was impossible to forget Jan,
the gay, kind-hearted husband, who had once
made all their echoes ring to his voice and
tread.</p>
<p>Never had the sense of her real widowhood
seemed so strong and so pitiful. But in spite
of its dreariness, the house attracted her.
There, better than in any other place, she could
rear her son, and devote her life to memories at
once so bitter and so sweet. She determined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
to speak that very night, unless her father were
unusually cross or thoughtful. Christmas was
a favorite date for weddings, and it was very
probable that Suneva would choose that time
for her own. If so, there would be barely time
to prepare the old home.</p>
<p>She set Peter&#8217;s tea-table with unusual care;
she made him the cream-cakes that he liked
so well, and saw that every thing was bright and
comfortable, and in accord with his peculiar
fancies. But Peter did not come home to tea,
and after waiting an hour, she put the service
away. It had become a very common disappointment.</p>
<p>Peter said something in a general way about
business, but Margaret was well aware, that
when he did not come home until ten o&#8217;clock,
he had taken tea with the Torrs, and spent the
evening with Suneva.</p>
<p>This night she had a very heavy heart.
Three times within the past week Peter had
been late. Things were evidently coming to a
crisis, and she felt the necessity of prompt
movement in her own interests. She put the
child to sleep, and sat down to wait for her
father&#8217;s arrival. About eight o&#8217;clock she heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
his voice and step, and before she could rise
and go with a candle to the door, Peter and
Suneva entered together.</p>
<p>There was something in their manner that
surprised her; the more so, that Suneva immediately
began to take off her bonnet and cloak,
and make herself quite at home. Margaret
saw then that she wore a rich silk dress and
many gold ornaments, and that her father also
wore his Sunday suit. The truth flashed upon
her in a moment. There was no need for Peter
to say&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suneva and I have just been married, Margaret.
Suppose thou make us a cup of tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that hour, and under such circumstances,
nothing could have induced her to obey the
request. Never before had she disobeyed her
father, and it gave her a shock to do it, but all
the same she enjoyed the sensation. Make tea
for Suneva! For the woman who had supplanted
her in her father&#8217;s affection, and in all
her rights! She felt that she would rather take
her child, and walk out with it upon the dark
and desolate moor.</p>
<p>But she was slow of speech, and in her anger
and amazement she could find no word to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
interpret her emotion. One long, steady look
she gave her father&mdash;a look which Peter never
forgot&mdash;then, haughtily as a discrowned queen,
but with a face as white as snow, she left the
room. Suneva laughed, but it was not an ill-natured
laugh. &#8220;It would have been better
had we told her, Peter,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If I had
been thy daughter, I should not have liked
thee to bring home a wife without a word
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be an ill day with Peter Fae when
he asks his women what he shall do, or how he
shall do it. Yes, indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>Suneva looked queerly at him. She did not
speak a word, but her dancing, gleaming eyes
said very plainly that such an &#8220;ill day&#8221; might
be coming even for Peter Fae.</p>
<p>Then she set herself to making the tea he
had asked for. There were the cakes Margaret
had baked, and sweets, and cold meat, and all
kinds of spirits at hand; and very soon Margaret
heard the pleasant clatter of china, and
the hum of subdued but constant conversation,
broken at intervals by Suneva&#8217;s shrill rippling
laugh. Margaret made up her mind that hour,
that however short or long her stay might be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
in Suneva&#8217;s house, she would never again lift a
finger in its ordering.</p>
<p>In the morning she remained in her own
room until her father had gone to the store.
When she went down stairs, she found the
servants, her servants, eagerly waiting upon
Suneva, who was examining her new possessions.
As she entered the room, Suneva turned
with a piece of the best china in her hand, and
said, &#8220;Oh, it is thee! Good morning, Margaret.&#8221;
Then in a moment Margaret&#8217;s dour, sulky
temper dominated her; she looked at Suneva,
but answered her not one word.</p>
<p>No two women could have been more unlike
each other. Margaret, dressed in a plain black
gown, was white and sorrowful. Suneva, in a
scarlet merino, carefully turned back over a
short quilted petticoat that gave pleasant
glimpses of her trim latched shoes and white
stockings, had a face and manner bright and
busy and thoroughly happy. Margaret&#8217;s dumb
anger did not seem to affect her. She went on
with her work, ordering, cleaning, rearranging,
sending one servant here and another there,
and took no more notice of the pale, sullen
woman on the hearth, than if she had not
existed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>However, when Margaret brought the child
down stairs, she made an effort at conciliation.
&#8220;What a beautiful boy!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;How like poor Jan! What dost thou call
him?&#8221; And she flipped her fingers, and
chirruped to the child, and really longed to take
him in her arms and kiss him.</p>
<p>But to Margaret the exclamation gave fresh
pain and offense. &#8220;What had Suneva to do
with Jan? And what right had she to pity
him, and to say &#8216;poor Jan!&#8217;&#8221; She did not
understand that very often a clumsy good
nature says the very thing it ought to avoid.
So she regarded the words as a fresh offense,
and drew her child closer to her, as if she were
afraid even it would be taken from her.</p>
<p>It was snowing lightly, and the air was moist
with a raw wind from the north-east. Yet Margaret
dressed herself and her child to go out.
At the door Suneva spoke again. &#8220;If thou
wants to go abroad, go; but leave the child
with me. I will take care of him, and it is
damp and cold, as thou seest.&#8221;</p>
<p>She might as well have spoken to the wind.
Margaret never delayed a moment for the
request; and Suneva stood looking after her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
with a singular gleam of pity and anger in her
eyes. There was also a kind of admiration for
the tall, handsome woman who in her perfect
health and strength bore so easily the burden
of her child. She held him firmly on her left
arm, and his little hand clasped her neck behind,
as with perfect grace she carried him, scarcely
conscious of his weight, especially when he
nestled his face against her own.</p>
<p>She went directly to her father&#8217;s store. It
was nearly noon when she arrived there, and it
was empty. Only Snorro stood beside the great
peat fire. He saw Margaret enter, and he
placed a chair for her in the warmest corner.
Then he said, &#8220;Give me little Jan, and I will
hold him for thee.&#8221; She put the boy in his
arms and watched him a moment as he shook
the snow from his cap and coat; then she said:
&#8220;Tell my father I want to speak to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter came somewhat reluctantly. He knew
the conversation had to be gone through, but
he felt as if Margaret had him at a disadvantage
in the store. Snorro was present, and
strangers might at any moment come in, and
hurry him into an unwise concession. He
was angry at Margaret, also, for her behavior
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
on the previous night, and it was not in any
amiable mood he approached her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, wilt thou have my house put in
order for me? I want to go back to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will; soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How soon, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not be hurried. There is no glass left
in it, and there are many things to repair
besides. It will take time and money, a good
deal of money, more than I can well afford at
present. I have had many expenses lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou then mean that I must live with
Suneva? No, I will not do that. I will go into
the house without windows. Snorro will patch
up the best ones, and board up the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snorro! Snorro, indeed! When was Snorro
thy servant? As for Suneva, she is as good as
thou art. Am I made of money to keep two
houses going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not ask thee for a penny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wilt make a martyr of thyself, and set
the town talking of me and of Suneva. No,
thou shalt not do such a thing. Go home and
behave thyself, and no one will say wrong to
thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not live with Suneva. If thou wilt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
not make a house habitable for me, then I will
hire a man to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wilt not dare. When it seems right
to me, I will do it. Wait thou my time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not wait. So then I will hire John
Hay&#8217;s empty cottage. It will do, poor as
it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If thou dost, I will never speak to thee nor
to thine again. I will not give thee nor thy
child a shilling, whether I be living or dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I do? Oh, what shall I do?&#8221; And
Margaret wrung her hands helplessly, and burst
into passionate weeping.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do&#8217;? Go home, and be thankful for thy
home. What would thou do in a Shetland
hut, alone, at the beginning of winter? And I
will not have thee come crying here. Mind
that! Take thy child and go home; go at
once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou might have told me! Thou might!
It was a cruel thing to take me unawares; at
a moment&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I had told thee, what then? Tears
and complaints, and endless wants. I had no
mind to be tormented as thou tormented thy
husband.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>That was a needlessly cruel taunt, and Peter
was ashamed of it as soon as uttered. But all
the same he turned away in anger, and two men
coming in at the moment, he went with them
to the other end of the store.</p>
<p>Snorro had held &#8220;little Jan&#8221; during the interview.
The fresh air and the heat had overpowered
the child, and he had fallen asleep.
He lay in Snorro&#8217;s arms, a beautiful, innocent
miniature of the man he loved so dearly.
Watching the sleeping face, he had seemed
unconscious of what passed between Peter and
his daughter, but in reality he had heard every
word. When Peter turned away he watched
Margaret put on her baby&#8217;s cap and coat, and
then as she rose with it folded in her arms, he
said, &#8220;Let me see him again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiss him, Snorro, for thou loved his father.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stooped and kissed the boy, and then
glanced into Margaret&#8217;s face. Her tears, her
pallor, her air of hopeless suffering went straight
to his heart. After all she was Jan&#8217;s wife. He
felt a great pity for her, and perhaps Margaret
divined it, for she said timidly, &#8220;Snorro, can
thou mend the windows in the old house&mdash;the
house where I lived with Jan?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilt thou ask my father if thou may do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do it. Have thou patience, Margaret
Vedder. It would be a sin if thou made the
child suffer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou think I would? Little does thou
know of a mother&#8217;s heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snorro!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Peter calling, and calling angrily;
but ere Snorro answered the summons he went
with Margaret to the door, and as he opened it,
said, &#8220;If I can help thee, for Jan&#8217;s sake I am
on thy side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very hard and bitter and cold was the walk
homeward. The snow fell thick and fast, and
she was tired and faint when she reached the
house. Never had its warmth and comfort
seemed so good to her. How could she feel
kindly to the woman who had robbed her and
her child of their right in it? Every one must
have noticed that when they are in trouble, the
weather is usually their enemy. A very long
and severe snow-storm followed Margaret&#8217;s
useless effort. She had perforce to sit still, and
for &#8220;little Jan&#8217;s&#8221; sake be grateful for the warmth
and shelter given her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>&#8220;<i>Little Jan</i>&#8221; Snorro had unconsciously
named the child. Several attempts had been
made to do so, but somehow all had hitherto
failed. At first &#8220;Peter&#8221; had been thought of;
but Peter Fae had not taken kindly to a Peter
Vedder, and the name after a few half-hearted
utterances had been dropped. Thora had
longed to call him &#8220;Willie,&#8221; but at her death
the scarcely recognized name was given up.
But Snorro&#8217;s tender, positive &#8220;little Jan&#8221; had
settled the matter in Margaret&#8217;s mind. Henceforward
the boy was to be called by his father&#8217;s
name, and she cared not whether it were liked
or not.</p>
<p>To Margaret the winter passed drearily away.
She refused to have any part in Suneva&#8217;s hospitalities,
though the &#8220;Fae House&#8221; became during
it as famous for its gayety, as it had been in
Thora&#8217;s time for its quiet and seclusion. Suneva
had no idea of being the mistress of a shut up
house. She was proud of her large rooms and
fine furniture, and anxious to exhibit them.
Besides which, she was in her element as hostess
of the cozy tea-party or the merry dance.</p>
<p>Fortunately for her peaceful success, Peter
discovered that he had the same taste. It had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
lain dormant and undeveloped during his
struggle for wealth, and in the quiet content
of Thora&#8217;s atmosphere; but every circumstance
now favored its growth, and he became quite
as proud of his name as a generous and splendid
host, as he was of his character as a keen
and successful trader.</p>
<p>He was still a handsome man, fresh and
active, carrying his fifty-eight years with all the
dignity of conscious independence and assured
position. It was Suneva&#8217;s great pride that she
had induced him to wear the fine cloth and velvet
and linen suitable to his wealth. She flattered
him into many an extravagance; she persuaded
him that no one in the Islands could recite as
well, or dance with more activity and grace.
Under her influence Peter renewed his youth
and enjoyed it. Margaret often heard them
planning some entertainment, and laughing
over it, with all the zest of twenty years.</p>
<p>To her, their whole life seemed an outrage.
She could not imagine how her father could
bear to put aside so completely his old habits
and memories. It wounded her to see him
going off with a joke and a kiss to the store in
the morning; and hurrying back at night, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
eager as a boy-bridegroom for the company of
his handsome wife and her gay friends. It may
easily be understood that even if Margaret had
countenanced Suneva&#8217;s festivities by her presence
at them, she would have been only a silent
and a reproachful guest.</p>
<p>It is but fair to say that Suneva gave to her
absence the best and kindest excuse. &#8220;Poor
Margaret!&#8221; she said pitifully, &#8220;she weeps constantly
for her husband. Few wives are as
faithful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suneva had indeed taken Thora&#8217;s place with
a full determination to be just and kind to
Thora&#8217;s daughter. She intended, now that fortune
had placed her above her old rival, to
treat her with respect and consideration.
Suneva was capable of great generosities, and
if Margaret had had the prudence and forbearance
to accept the peace offered, she might have
won whatever she desired through the influence
of her child, for whom Suneva conceived a very
strong attachment.</p>
<p>But this was just the point which Margaret
defended with an almost insane jealousy. She
saw that little Jan clung to Suneva, that he
liked to be with her, that he often cried in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
solitude of her room to go down stairs, where
he knew he would have sweetmeats, and petting,
and company, and his own way. If ever
she was cross to the boy, it was on this subject.
She would not even be bribed by Suneva&#8217;s most
diplomatic services in his behalf. &#8220;Let Jan
come where his grandfather is, Margaret,&#8221; she
pleaded. &#8220;It will be for his good; I tell thee
it will. I have already persuaded him that the
boy has his eyes, and his figure, and when he
was in a passion the other night, and thy father
was like to be cross with him, I said, &#8216;It is a
nice thing to see Satan correcting sin, for the
child has thy own quick temper, Peter,&#8217; and thy
father laughed and pulled little Jan to his side,
and gave him the lump of sugar he wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy is all thou hast left me. Would
thou take him also?&#8221; Margaret answered with
angry eyes. &#8220;His mother&#8217;s company is good
enough for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>So all winter the hardly-admitted strife went
on. Suneva pitied the child. She waylaid him
and gave him sweetmeats and kisses. She imagined
that he daily grew more pale and quiet.
And Margaret, suspicious and watchful, discovered
much, and imagined more. She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
determined to go away from Suneva as soon as
the spring opened, but she had come to the
conclusion that she must look after her house
herself, for though Snorro had promised to make
it habitable, evidently he had been unable to
do so, or he would have contrived to let her
know.</p>
<p>One day in the latter part of April, all nature
suddenly seemed to awake. The winter was
nearly over. Margaret heard the larks singing in
the clear sunshine. Little Jan had fallen asleep
and might remain so for a couple of hours.
She put on her cloak and bonnet, and went to
see how far Snorro had been able to keep his
word. Things were much better than she had
hoped for. Nearly all of the windows had
been reglazed, the gate was hung, and the
accumulated drift of two years in the yard
cleared away.</p>
<p>With lighter spirits, and a firm determination
in her heart, she walked swiftly back to her
child. When she entered the door she heard
his merry laugh in Suneva&#8217;s parlor. He was
standing on her knee, singing after her some
lines of a fisherman&#8217;s &#8220;Casting Song,&#8221; swaying
backwards and forwards, first on one foot and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
then on the other, to the melody. Suneva was
so interested in the boy, that, for a moment,
she did not notice the pale, angry woman
approaching her. When she did, her first
thought was conciliation. &#8220;I heard him crying,
Margaret; and as I knew thou wert out,
I went for him. He is a merry little fellow, he
hath kept me laughing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, Jan!&#8221; In her anger, she
grasped the child&#8217;s arm roughly, and he cried
out, and clung to Suneva.</p>
<p>Then Margaret&#8217;s temper mastered her as it
had never done before in her life. She struck
the child over and over again, and, amid its
cries of pain and fright, she said some words to
Suneva full of bitterness and contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thee love thy child!&#8221; cried Suneva in a
passion, &#8220;not thou, indeed! Thou loves no
earthly thing but thyself. Every day the poor
baby suffers for thy bad temper&mdash;even as his
father did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak thou not of his father&mdash;thou, who
first tempted him away from his home and his
wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When thou says such a thing as that, then
thou lies; I tempted him not. I was sorry for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
him, as was every man and woman in Lerwick.
Poor Jan Vedder!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told thee not to speak of my husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thy husband!&#8221; cried Suneva scornfully.
&#8220;Where is he? Thou may well turn pale.
Good for thee is it that the Troll Rock hasn&#8217;t
a tongue! Thou cruel woman! I wonder at
myself that I have borne with thee so long.
Thou ought to be made to tell what thou did
with Jan Vedder!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What art thou saying? What dost thou
mean? I will not listen to thee&#8221;&mdash;and she
lifted the weeping child in her arms, and turned
to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;But at last thou shalt listen. I have spared
thee long enough. Where is Jan Vedder?
Thou knows and thou only; and that is what
every one says of thee. Is he at the bottom
of the Troll Rock? And who pushed him
over? Answer that, Margaret Vedder!&#8221;</p>
<p>Suneva, in her passion, almost shrieked out
these inquiries. Her anger was so violent, that
it silenced her opponent. But no words could
have interpreted the horror and anguish in
Margaret&#8217;s face, when she realized the meaning
of Suneva&#8217;s questions. The sudden storm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
ended in the lull which follows recrimination.
Suneva sat fuming and muttering to herself;
Margaret, in her room, paced up and down, the
very image of despairing shame and sorrow.
When her father returned she knew Suneva
would tell him all that had transpired. To face
them both was a trial beyond her strength. She
looked at her child softly sobbing on the bed
beside her, and her heart melted at the injustice
she had done him. But she felt that she must
take him away from Suneva, or he would be
stolen from her; worse than stolen, he would
be made to regard her as a terror and a tyrant.</p>
<p>She heard the clatter of the tea-cups and the
hum of conversation, and knew that her father
was at home. As soon as he had finished his
tea, she would probably be summoned to his
presence. It had grown dark and a rain-storm
was coming; nevertheless she dressed herself
and little Jan, and quietly went out of the
house. Peter and Suneva were discussing the
quarrel over their tea; the servants sat spinning
by the kitchen fire, doing the same. She
only glanced at them, and then she hastened
toward the town as fast as she could.</p>
<p>Snorro was sitting at the store-fire, a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
pot of tea, a barley cake, and a broiled herring
by his side. He was thinking of Jan, and lo!
a knock at the door&mdash;just such a knock as Jan
always gave. His heart bounded with hope;
before he thought of possibilities he had
opened it. Not Jan, but Jan&#8217;s wife and child,
and both of them weeping. He said not a
word, but he took Margaret&#8217;s hand and led her
to the fire. Her cloak and hood were dripping
with the rain, and he removed and shook them.
Then he lifted the child in his arms and gave
him some tea, and soon soothed his trouble
and dried his tears.</p>
<p>Margaret sobbed and wept with a passion
that alarmed him. He had thought at first
that he would not interfere, but his tender
heart could not long endure such evident distress
without an effort to give comfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter with thee, Margaret
Vedder? and why art thou and thy child
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have nowhere else to go to-night,
Snorro.&#8221; Then Margaret told him every thing.</p>
<p>He listened in silence, making no comments,
asking no questions, until she finished in another
burst of anguish, as she told him of Suneva&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
accusation. Then he said gravely: &#8220;It is a
shame. Drink this cup of tea, and then we will
go to the minister. He only can guide the
boat in this storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not go there, Snorro. I have been
almost rude and indifferent to him. Three
times he has written to me concerning my
duty; many times he has talked to me about
it. Now he will say, &#8216;Thou hast reaped the
harvest thou sowed, Margaret Vedder.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will say no unkind word to thee. I
tell thee thou must go. There is none else
that can help thee. Go for little Jan&#8217;s sake.
Wrap the boy up warm. Come.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was weeping and weary, but Snorro took
her to the manse, carrying little Jan under his
own coat. Margaret shrank from an interview
with Dr. Balloch, but she had no need. He
was not a man to bruise the broken reed; no
sooner did he cast his eyes upon the forlorn
woman than he understood something of the
crisis that had brought her to him for advice
and protection.</p>
<p>He took them into his cheerful parlor, and
sent their wet clothing to the kitchen to be
dried. Then he said: &#8220;Snorro, now thou go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
and help Hamish to make us a good supper.
It is ill facing trouble on an empty stomach.
And light a fire, Snorro, in the room up stairs;
thou knowest which room; for Margaret and
her son will have to sleep there. And after
that, thou stop with Hamish, for it will be
better so.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were no reproofs now on the good
doctor&#8217;s lips. He never reminded Margaret
how often he had striven to win her confidence
and to lead her to the only source of comfort
for the desolate and broken-hearted. First of
all, he made her eat, and dry and warm herself;
then he drew from her the story of her grief
and wrongs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou must have thy own home, Margaret,
that is evident,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and as for Suneva, I
will see to her in the morning. Thou art innocent
of thy husband&#8217;s death, I will make her to
know that. Alas! how many are there, who if
they can not wound upon proof, will upon
likelihood! Now there is a room ready for
thee, and thou must stay here, until this matter
is settled for thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed a very haven of rest to Margaret.
She went to it gratefully, and very soon fell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
into that deep slumber which in youth follows
great emotions. When she awoke the fire had
been re-built, and little Jan&#8217;s bread and milk
stood beside it. It was a dark, dripping morning;
the rain smote the windows in sudden,
gusts, and the wind wailed drearily around the
house. But in spite of the depressing outside
influences, her heart was lighter than it had
been for many a day. She felt as those feel
&#8220;who have escaped;&#8221; and she dressed and fed
her child with a grateful heart.</p>
<p>When she went down stairs she found that,
early as it was, the doctor had gone to her
father&#8217;s house; and she understood that this
visit was made in order to see him where conversation
would not be interrupted by the
entrance of buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>Dr. Balloch found Peter sitting at breakfast
with Suneva, in his usual cheerful, self-complacent
mood. In fact, he knew nothing of
Margaret&#8217;s flight from his house. She rarely
left her boy to join the tea-table; she never
appeared at the early breakfast. Her absence
was satisfactory to both parties, and had long
ceased to call forth either protest or remark.
So neither of them were aware of the step she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
had taken, and the minister&#8217;s early visit did not
connect itself with her, until he said gravely to
Peter, &#8220;Dost thou know where thy daughter is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She hath not left her room yet,&#8221; answered
Suneva; &#8220;she sleeps late for the child&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She hath left thy house, Peter. Last night
I gave her and the child shelter from the
storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter rose in a great passion: &#8220;Then she can
stay away from my house. Here she comes
back no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that, too. It is better she should
not come back. But now thou must see that
her own home is got ready for her, and that
quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The house thou gave her at her marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave her no house. She had the use of
it. The title deeds never left my hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then more shame to thee. Did thou not
boast to every one, that thou had given the
house and the plenishing? No title deeds,
no lawyer&#8217;s paper, can make the house more
Margaret Vedder&#8217;s than thy own words have
done. Thou wilt not dare to break thy promise,
thou, who ate the Bread of Remembrance only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
last Sabbath Day. Begin this very hour to put
the house in order, and then put the written
right to it in her hands. Any hour thou may
be called to give an account; leave the matter
beyond disputing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take a week to glaze and clean it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is glazed and cleaned. Michael Snorro
brought the sashes one by one to the store, and
glazed them, when he had done his work at
night. He hath also mended the plaster, and
kept a fire in the house to dry it; and he hath
cleaned the yard and re-hung the gate. Begin
thou at once to move back again the furniture.
It never ought to have been removed, and I
told thee that at the time. Thou knowest also
what promises thou made me, and I will see
that thou keep them every one, Peter Fae.
Yes, indeed, I will!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too wet to move furniture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rain will be over at the noon. Until
then thy men can carry peats and groceries, and
such store of dried meats as will be necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter,&#8221; said Suneva indignantly, &#8220;I counsel
thee to do nothing in a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Balloch answered her, &#8220;I counsel thee,
Mistress Fae, to keep well the door of thy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
mouth. It is no light thing to make the
charges thou hast made against an innocent
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked her how Jan Vedder got his death?
Let her tell that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might ask thee how Paul Glumm got his
death! Listen now, and I will show thee what
a great thing may come from one foul suspicion.
Thou married Paul Glumm, and it is
well known he and thee were not always in
the same mind, for thou loved company and he
loved quiet. Then Glumm took thee to the
Skoolfiord, where there were none at the station
but thee and he. Thou knowest how thou
rebelled at that, and how often thou could be
found in thy father&#8217;s house. Suddenly Glumm
takes a sickness, and when a doctor sees him
there is little hope, and after three days he dies.
Then thou art back at Lerwick again, quick
enough, and in a few weeks thou hast plenty of
lovers. Now, then, how easy to say, &#8216;Glumm&#8217;s
death was a very strange affair!&#8217; &#8216;Such a
strong young man!&#8217; &#8216;Did his wife know any
thing about it?&#8217; &#8216;Did she send for a doctor
as soon as might be?&#8217; &#8216;Did she give him the
medicine the doctor left?&#8217; &#8216;Was she not very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
glad when she was free again?&#8217; Mistress Fae,
I say not these things were so, or were even
said, I am only trying to show thee how easy
it is out of nothing at all to make up a very
suspicious case. But come, Peter, there is duty
to be done, and I know that thou wilt do it.
And I am in haste about it, for it is not easy
for Hamish to have a woman and child at the
manse. Hamish has failed much lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send the woman with her child here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, for it is easier to avoid quarrels than to
mend them. Margaret shall stay at the manse
till her own house is ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they went away together, leaving Suneva
crying with anger; partly because of the minister&#8217;s
lecture; partly because she thought
Peter had not &#8220;stood up for her&#8221; as he ought
to have done. As for Peter, though he did not
think of disobeying the order given him, yet
he resented the interference; and he was
intensely angry at Margaret for having caused
it. When he arrived at the store, he was made
more so by Snorro&#8217;s attitude. He sat upon a
sailor&#8217;s chest with his hands folded before him,
though the nets were to be examined and a
score of things to get for the fishers.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Can thou find nothing for thy lazy hands
to do?&#8221; he asked scornfully, &#8220;or are they
weary of the work thou hast been doing at
night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mind is not to lift a finger for thee
again, Peter Fae; and as for what I do at
night, that is my own affair. I robbed thee not,
neither of time nor gear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From whence came the glass, and the nails,
and the wood, and the hinges?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I bought them with my own money. If
thou pays me the outlay it will be only just.
The work I gave freely to the wife of Jan Vedder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then since thou hast mended the house,
thou may carry back the furniture into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do that freely also. Thou never ought
to have counseled its removal; for that reason,
I blame thee for all that followed it.&#8221; Snorro
then hailed a passing fisherman, and they lifted
his chest in order to go away.</p>
<p>&#8220;What art thou taking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My own clothes, and my own books, and
whatever is my own. Nothing of thine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For that I will come no more here.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, thou wilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter was much troubled. Angry as he was,
grief at Snorro&#8217;s defection was deeper than any
other feeling. For nearly twenty years he had
relied on him. Besides the inconvenience to
the business, the loss of faith was bitter. But
he said no more at that time. When Margaret
was in her home, Snorro would be easier to manage.
More as a conciliatory measure with him,
than as kindness to his offending daughter, he
said, &#8220;First of all, however, take a load of tea,
and sugar and flour, and such things as will be
needed; thou knowest them. Take what thou
wishes, and all thou wishes; then, thou canst
not say evil of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did I say evil of thee, only to thy
face? Michael Snorro hath but one tongue.
It knows not how to slander or to lie. Pay me
my wages, and I will go, and speak to thee no
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do what I said and come back to me in
three days; then we will settle this trouble
between us;&#8221; saying which, Peter went into
his counting house, and Snorro went to work
with all his will and strength to get Margaret&#8217;s
house ready for her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>But though he hired three men to help him,
it was the evening of the second day before she
could remove to it. It was a different homecoming
from her previous one in that dwelling.
Then all had been in exquisitely spotless order,
and Jan had turned and kissed her at the open
door. This night every thing was in confusion.
Snorro had carried all her belongings into the
house, but they were unpacked and unarranged.
Still he had done a great deal. A large fire
was burning, the kettle boiling on the hearth,
and on the little round table before it he had
put bread and milk and such things as would
be necessary for a first meal. Then, with an
innate delicacy he had gone away, fully understanding
that at the first Margaret would wish
to be quite alone.</p>
<p>She stood a minute and looked around.
Then she opened the box in which her china
and silver were packed. In half an hour the
tea-table was spread. She even made a kind of
festival of the occasion by giving little Jan the
preserved fruit he loved with his bread. It
seemed to her as if food had never tasted so
good before. She was again at her own table;
at her own fireside! Her own roof covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
her! There was no one to gloom at her or
make her feel uncomfortable. Work, poverty,
all things, now seemed possible and bearable.</p>
<p>When Jan had chattered himself weary she
laid him in his cot, and sat hour after hour in
the dim light of the glowing peats, thinking,
planning, praying, whispering Jan&#8217;s name to her
heart, feeling almost as if she were in his presence.
When at length she rose and turned the
key in her own house again, she was as proud
and as happy as a queen who has just come
into her kingdom, and who lifts for the first
time the scepter of her authority.</p>

</div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent18'>&#8220;Now the great heart</p>
<p>Leaps to new action and appointed toil</p>
<p>With steady hope, sure faith, and sober joy.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>During the next two years, Margaret&#8217;s
life appeared to be monotonously without
incident. In reality it deepened and broadened
in a manner but slightly indicated by the stillness
of its surface. Early in the morning
following her re-occupation of her own house,
she had two visitors, Dr. Balloch and her old
servant, Elga.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elga&#8217;s husband is with the Greenland fleet,&#8221;
said the minister; &#8220;she is poor and lonely, and
wants to come back and serve thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can not afford a servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou can well afford it, take my word for
that; besides, thou art not used to hard work
nor fit for it. Also, I have something better
for thee to do. When thy house is in order,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
come to the manse and see me, then we will
talk of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Elga quietly resumed her old duties, and
ere two weeks were gone the house was almost
in its first condition. White paint and soap
and water, bees&#8217;-wax and turpentine, needle
and thread, did wonders. On the evening of
the eleventh day, Margaret and Elga went
from attic to cellar with complete satisfaction.
Every thing was spotless, every thing was in
its old place. Jan&#8217;s big cushioned chair again
stood on the hearth, and little Jan took possession
of it. Many a night, wearied with play,
he cuddled himself up among its cushions, and
had there his first sleep. It is easy to imagine
what Margaret&#8217;s thoughts were with such a
picture before her&mdash;tender, regretful, loving
thoughts most surely, for the fine shawl or
stocking she was knitting at the time was
generally wet with her tears.</p>
<p>The day after all was in its place and settled,
she went to see Dr. Balloch. It was in the
early morning when every thing was sweet,
and cool and fresh. The blue-bells and daisies
were at her feet, the sea dimpling and sparkling
in the sunshine, the herring-fleet gathering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
in the bay. Already the quays and streets
were full of strangers, and many a merry
young fisherman with a pile of nets flung over
his shoulders passed her, singing and whistling
in the fullness of his life and hope. All of
them, in some way or other, reminded her of
Jan. One carried his nets in the same graceful,
nonchalant way; another wore his cap at
the same angle; a third was leaning against his
oars, just as she had seen Jan lean a hundred
times.</p>
<p>The minister sat at his open door, looking
seaward. His serene face was full of the peace
and light of holy contemplation. His right
hand was lovingly laid on the open Bible,
which occupied the small table by his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Margaret,&#8221; he said pleasantly.
&#8220;Come in; is all well with thee now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every thing is well. The house is in order
and Snorro hath promised to plant some berry
bushes in my garden; he will plant them
to-day with the flower seeds thou gave me.
The snowdrops are in bloom already, and the
pansies show their buds among the leaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou know that Snorro hath left thy
father?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He told me that he had taken John Hay&#8217;s
cottage, the little stone one on the hill above
my house, and that in three days he would go
to the fishing with Matthew Vale.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, what wilt thou do with thy
time? Let me tell thee, time is a very precious
gift of God; so precious that he only gives it
to us moment by moment. He would not
have thee waste it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret took from her pocket a piece of
knitting. It was a shawl twelve yards round,
yet of such exquisite texture that she drew it
easily through a wedding ring. Beautiful it
was as the most beautiful lace, and the folds of
fine wool fell infinitely softer than any fold of
fine flax could do. It was a marvelous piece
of handiwork, and Dr. Balloch praised it
highly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to send it to the Countess of
Zetland,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have no doubt she will
send me as many orders as I can fill. Each
shawl is worth £7, and I can also do much
coarser work, which I shall sell at the Foy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would thou not rather work for me than
for the Countess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou knowest I would, ten thousand times
rather. But how can I work for thee?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What is there, Margaret, on the long table
under the window?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a large pile of newspapers and
magazines and books.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is so. None of these have I been
able to read, because my sight has failed me
very much lately. Yet I long to know every
word that is in them. Wilt thou be eyes to an
old man who wishes thee only well, Margaret?
Come every day, when the weather and thy
health permits, and read to me for two hours,
write my letters for me, and do me a message
now and then, and I will cheerfully pay thee
£50 a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would gladly do all this without money,
and think the duty most honorable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, but I will pay thee, for that will be
better for thee and for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now all good work is good for far more than
appears upon its surface. The duties undertaken
by Margaret grew insensibly and steadily
in beneficence and importance. In the first
place, the effect upon her own character was
very great. It was really two hours daily
study of the finest kind. It was impossible
that the books put into her hand could be read
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
and discussed with a man like Dr. Balloch
without mental enlargement. Equally great
and good was the moral effect of the companionship.
Her pen became the pen of a
ready writer, for the old clergyman kept up a
constant correspondence with his college companions,
and with various learned societies.</p>
<p>About three months after this alliance began,
the doctor said one day, &#8220;Thou shalt not read
to me this morning, for I want thee to carry
some wine and jelly to old Neill Brock, and
when thou art there, read to him. Here is a
list of the Psalms and the Epistles that will be
the best for him.&#8221; And Margaret came back
from her errand with a solemnly happy light
upon her face. &#8220;It was a blessed hour,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;surely he is very near the kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>This service once begun grew by a very natural
course of events. Margaret delighted in
it. The sick loved her calm, gentle ways. She
was patient and silent, and yet sympathetic.
She had that womanly taste which naturally
sets itself to make dainty dishes for those who
can not eat coarse food. In a few months the
sick all through the parish felt the soothing
touch of her soft, cool hands, and became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
familiar with the tones of her low, even voice,
as she read aloud the portions which Dr. Balloch
usually selected for every case.</p>
<p>And as there is no service so gratefully
remembered as that given in sickness, Margaret
Vedder gradually acquired a very sincere popularity.
It rather amazed Peter to hear such
remarks as the following: &#8220;Luke Thorkel is
better, thanks to Margaret Vedder.&#8221; &#8220;John
Johnson can go to the fishing with an easy mind
now, Margaret Vedder is caring for his sick
wife.&#8221; &#8220;The Widow Hay died last night.
She would have died ere this, but for Margaret
Vedder&#8217;s care.&#8221;</p>
<p>These outside duties made her home duties
sufficient to fill all her time. She had no hours
to spare for foolish repining, or morbid sorrow.
Little Jan must be taught his letters, and his
clothes must be made. Her garden, poultry
and knitting kept her hands ever busy, and
though her work was much of it of that silent
kind which leads to brooding thought, she had
now much of interest to fill her mind. Yet
still, and always, there was the haunting, underlying
memory of Jan&#8217;s disappearance or death,
keeping her life hushed and silent. To no one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
did she speak of it, and it seemed strange to
her that Dr. Balloch visibly discouraged any
allusion to it. Sometimes she felt as if she
must speak to Snorro about it, but Snorro kept
ever a little aloof from her. She was not very
sure as to his friendship.</p>
<p>She thought this a little hard, for she had
given him every opportunity to understand that
her own animosity was dead. She permitted
little Jan to spend nearly all his time with him,
when he was not engaged in fishing, or busy on
the quays. And Snorro now spent much of
his time at home. His earnings during the
fishing season more than sufficed for his
wants. Every fine day in winter he was apt
to call for little Jan, and Margaret rarely refused
him the child&#8217;s company.</p>
<p>And little Jan dearly loved Snorro. Snorro
put him in the water, and taught him how to
swim like a seal. Snorro made him a spear and
taught him how to throw it. He made him a
boat and taught him how to sail it. He got
him a pony and taught him how to ride it.
Once they found a baby seal whose mother had
been shot, and the child kept it at Snorro&#8217;s
house. There also he had a dozen pet rabbits,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
and three Skye terriers, and a wild swan with a
broken wing, and many other treasures, which
would not have been so patiently tolerated in
the cleanliness and order of his own home.</p>
<p>So the time went pleasantly and profitably
by for two years. Again the spring joy was
over the land, and the town busy with the
hope of the fishing season. Snorro&#8217;s plans
were all made, and yet he felt singularly restless
and unsettled. As he sat one evening
wondering at this feeling, he said to himself:
&#8220;It is the dreams I have had lately, or it is
because I think of Jan so much. Why does
he not write? Oh, how I long to see him!
Well, the day will come, by God&#8217;s leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as this thought crossed his mind, Dr.
Balloch stepped across his threshold. Snorro
rose up with a face of almost painful anxiety.
He always associated a visit from the doctor
with news from Jan. He could scarcely articulate
the inquiry, &#8220;Hast thou any news?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great news for thee, Snorro. Jan is coming
home from Africa. He is broken down
with the fever. He wants thee. Thou must
go to him at once, for he hath done grand
work, and proved himself a hero, worthy even
of thy true great love.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I am ready&mdash;I have been waiting for him
to call me. I will go this hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be patient. Every thing must be done
wisely and in order. The first thing is supper.
I came away without mine, so now I will eat
with thee. Get the tea ready; then I will tell
thee all I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Snorro moved about, the doctor looked
at his home. Every piece of furniture in it
was of Snorro&#8217;s own manufacture. His bed
was a sailor&#8217;s bunk against the wall, made soft
with sheep-fleeces and covered with seal-skins.
A chair of woven rushes for little Jan, a couple
of stools and a table made from old packing
boxes, and a big hearth-rug of sheep-skins, that
was all. But over the fireplace hung the
pictured Christ, and some rude shelves were
filled with the books Jan had brought him.
On the walls, also, were harpoons and seal
spears, a fowling-piece, queer ribbons and
branches of sea weeds, curiosities given him by
sailors from all countries, stuffed birds and fish
skeletons, and a score of other things, which
enabled the doctor to understand what a house
of enchantment it must be to a boy like little
Jan.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>In a few minutes the table was set, and
Snorro had poured out the minister&#8217;s tea, and
put before him a piece of bread and a slice of
broiled mutton. As for himself he could not
eat, he only looked at the doctor with eyes of
pathetic anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snorro, dost thou understand that to go to
Jan now is to leave, forever perhaps, thy native
land?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wherever Jan is, that land is best of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will be in Portsmouth ere thou arrive
there. First, thou must sail to Wick; there,
thou wilt get a boat to Leith, and at Leith take
one for London. What wilt thou do in
London?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I have a tongue in my head; I
will ask my way to Portsmouth. When I am
there it will be easy to find Jan&#8217;s ship, and then
Jan. What help can thou give me in the
matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I will look to. Jan hath sent thee
£100.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snorro&#8217;s face brightened like sunrise. &#8220;I
am glad that he thought of me; but I will not
touch the money. I have already more than
£20. Thou shalt keep the £100 for little
Jan.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Snorro, he hath also sent the £600 he took
from his wife, that and the interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how? How could he do that already?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has won it from the men who coin life
into gold; it is mostly prize money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck to Jan&#8217;s hands! That is much
to my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell thee one instance, and that will
make thee understand it better. Thou must
know that it is not a very easy matter to blockade
over three thousand miles of African coast,
especially as the slave ships are very swift, and
buoyant. Indeed the Spanish and Portuguese
make theirs of very small timbers and beams
which they screw together. When chased the
screws are loosened, and this process gives the
vessel amazing play. Their sails are low, and
bent broad. Jan tells me that the fore-yard of
a brig of one hundred and forty tons, taken by
&#8216;The Retribution&#8217; was seventy-six feet long,
and her ropes so beautifully racked aloft,
that after a cannonade of sixty shot, in
which upward of fifty took effect, not one sail
was lowered. Now thou must perceive that a
chase in the open sea would mostly be in favor
of vessels built so carefully for escape.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why, then, do not the Government build
the same kind of vessels?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is another matter. I will go into no
guesses about it. But they do not build them,
and therefore captures are mostly made by the
boats which are sent up the rivers to lie in wait
for the slavers putting out to sea. Sometimes
these boats are away for days, sometimes even
for weeks; and an African river is a dreadful
place for British sailors, Snorro: the night air
is loaded with fever, the days are terrible with
a scorching sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can believe that; but what of Jan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One morning Jan, with a four-oared gig,
chased a slave brig. They had been at the river
mouth all night watching for her. Thou knows,
Snorro, what a fine shot our Jan is. When she
came in sight he picked off five of her crew, and
compelled her to run on shore to avoid being
boarded. Then her crew abandoned her, in
order to save their own lives, and &#8216;The Retribution&#8217;
hove her off. She proved to be a vessel of
two hundred tons, and she carried one thousand
slaves. She was taken as a prize into Sierra
Leone, and sold, and then Jan got his share of
her.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But why did not the slavers fight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad men are not always brave men; and
sometimes they fly when no man pursues them.
Portuguese slavers are proverbial cowards, yet
sometimes Jan did have a hard fight with the
villains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am right glad of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About a year ago, he heard of a brigantine
of great size and speed lying in the old Calabar
river with a cargo of slaves destined for Cuba.
She carried five eighteen-pounder guns, and a
crew of eighty men; and her captain had vowed
vengeance upon &#8216;The Retribution&#8217; and upon
Jan, for the slavers he had already taken. Jan
went down to the old Calabar, but he could not
enter it, so he kept out of sight, waiting for the
slaver to put to sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;At length she was seen coming down the
river under all sail. Then &#8216;The Retribution&#8217;
lowered her canvas in order to keep out of sight
as long as possible. When she hoisted it again,
the slaver in spite of her boasts endeavored to
escape, and then Jan, setting all the canvas his
schooner could carry, stood after her in chase.
The slaver was the faster of the two, and Jan
feared he would lose her; but fortunately a calm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
came on and both vessels got out their sweeps.
Jan&#8217;s vessel, being the smaller, had now the
advantage, and his men sent her flying through
the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;All night they kept up the chase, and the
next morning Jan got within range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried Snorro, &#8220;if I had only been
there! Why did no one tell me there was such
work for strong men to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I will tell thee a grand thing that our
Jan did. Though the slaver was cutting his
rigging to pieces with her shot, Jan would not
fire till he was close enough to aim only at her
decks. Why, Snorro? Because below her
decks there was packed in helpless misery five
hundred black men, besides many women and
little children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was like Jan. He has a good
heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But when he was close enough, he loaded his
guns with grape, and ordered two men to be
ready to lash the slaver to &#8216;The Retribution,&#8217;
the moment they touched. Under cover of the
smoke, Jan and ten men boarded the slaver, but
unfortunately, the force of the collision drove
&#8216;The Retribution&#8217; off, and Jan and his little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
party found themselves opposed to the eighty
villains who formed the slaver&#8217;s crew.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a moment it seemed as if they must be
overpowered, but a gallant little midshipman,
only fourteen years old, Snorro, think of that,
gave an instant order to get out the sweeps,
and almost immediately &#8216;The Retribution,&#8217; was
alongside, and securely lashed to her enemy.
Then calling on the sailors to follow him the
brave little lad boarded her, and a desperate
hand to hand fight followed. After fifteen
Spaniards had been killed and near forty
wounded, the rest leaped below and cried for
quarter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snorro would have given them just ten minutes
to say a prayer, no more. It is a sin to be
merciful to the wicked, it is that; and the kindness
done to them is unblessed, and brings forth
sin and trouble. I have seen it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What thinkest thou? When Jan flung open
the hatches under which the poor slaves were
fastened, sixty were dead, one hundred and
twenty dying. During the twenty-eight hours&#8217;
chase and fight in that terrible climate they had
not been given a drop of water, and the air was
putrid and hot as an oven. Most of them had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
to be carried out in the arms of Jan&#8217;s sailors.
There were seven babies in this hell, and thirty-three
children between the ages of two years
and seven. Many more died before Jan could
reach Sierra Leone with them. This is the work
Jan has been doing, Snorro; almost I wish I
was a young man again, and had been with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor&#8217;s eyes were full; Snorro&#8217;s head
was in his hands upon the table. When the
doctor ceased, he stood up quivering with
anger, and said, &#8220;If God would please Michael
Snorro, he would send him to chase and fight
such devils. He would give them the measure
they gave to others, little air and less water,
and a rope&#8217;s end to finish them. That would
be good enough for them; it would that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, thou wilt go to Jan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go to-morrow. How can I wait
longer? Is there a mail boat in the harbor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Lord Lynne brought me the news
and the money. He will carry thee as far as
Wick. The tide serves at five o&#8217;clock to-morrow
morning, can thou be ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, surely. Great joy hath come to me,
but I can be ready to meet it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Lean on me in this matter as much as thou
likest; what is there I can do for thee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilt thou care for what I have in my house,
especially the picture?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I have but to see Margaret Vedder
and little Jan. I will be on &#8216;The Lapwing,&#8217; ere
she lift her anchor. God bless thee for all the
good words thou hast said to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snorro!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When thou sees Jan, say what will make
peace between him and Margaret.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snorro&#8217;s brow clouded. &#8220;I like not to
meddle in the matter. What must be is sure
to happen, whether I speak or speak not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But mind this&mdash;it will be thy duty to speak
well of Margaret Vedder. The whole town do
that now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was ever a good woman some way.
There is not now a name too good for her. It
hath become the fashion to praise Jan Vedder&#8217;s
wife, and also to pity her. If thou heard the
talk, thou would think that Jan was wholly to
blame. For all that, I do not think she is
worthy of Jan. Why does she not talk to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
son of his father? Who ever saw her weep at
Jan&#8217;s name? I had liked her better if she had
wept more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is little men know of women; their
smiles and their tears alike are seldom what
they seem. I think Margaret loves her husband
and mourns his loss sincerely; but she is not a
woman to go into the market-place to weep.
Do what is right and just to her, I counsel
thee to do that. Now I will say &#8216;Farewell,
brave Snorro.&#8217; We may not meet again, for I
am growing old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall anchor in the same harbor at last.
If thou go first, whatever sea I am on, speak
me on thy way, if thou can do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps so. Who can tell? Farewell,
mate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Farewell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snorro watched him across the moor, and
then going to a locked box, he took out of it a
bundle in a spotted blue handkerchief. He
untied it, and for a moment looked over the
contents. They were a bracelet set with sapphires,
a ring to match it, a gold brooch, an
amber comb and necklace, a gold locket on a
chain of singular beauty, a few ribbons and lace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
collars, and a baby coral set with silver bells;
the latter had been in Jan&#8217;s pocket when he
was shipwrecked, and it was bruised and
tarnished. The sight of it made Snorro&#8217;s
eyes fill, and he hastily knotted the whole of
the trinkets together and went down to Margaret&#8217;s
home.</p>
<p>It was near nine o&#8217;clock and Margaret was
tired and not very glad to see him coming, for
she feared his voice would awake little Jan who
was sleeping in his father&#8217;s chair. Rather
wearily she said, &#8220;What is the matter, Snorro?
Is any one sick? Speak low, for little Jan is
asleep, and he has been very tiresome to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing much is the matter, to thee. As
for me, I am going away in the morning to the
mainland. I may not be back very soon, and
I want to kiss Jan, and to give thee some things
which belong to thee, if thou cares for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What hast thou of mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilt thou look then? They are in the
handkerchief.&#8221;</p>
<p>He watched her keenly, perhaps a little
hardly, as she untied the knot. He watched
the faint rose-color deepen to scarlet on her
face; he saw how her hands trembled, as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
laid one by one the jewels on the table, and
thoughtfully fingered the lace yellow with
neglect. But there were no tears in her
dropped eyes, and she could scarcely have been
more deliberate in her examination, if she had
been appraising their value. And yet, her heart
was burning and beating until she found it
impossible to speak.</p>
<p>Snorro&#8217;s anger gathered fast. His own feelings
were in such a state of excitement, that
they made him unjust to a type of emotion
unfamiliar to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then,&#8221; he asked, sharply, &#8220;dost thou
want them or not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan bought them for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he bought them, and thou sent them
back to him. If thou had sent me one back,
I had never bought thee another. But Jan
Vedder was not like other men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not talk of Jan, thee and me.
What did thou bring these to-night for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told thee I was going to Wick, and it
would not be safe to leave them, nor yet to
take them with me. I was so foolish, also, as
to think that thou would now prize them for
Jan&#8217;s sake, but I see thou art the same woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
yet. Give them to me, I will take them to the
minister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave them here. I will keep them safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rattle was bought for little Jan. It
was in his father&#8217;s pocket when he was shipwrecked.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood with it in her hand, gazing down
upon the tarnished bells, and answered not a
word. Snorro looked at her angrily, and then
stooped down, and softly kissed the sleeping
child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Margaret Vedder!&#8221;</p>
<p>She had lifted the locket in the interval, and
was mechanically passing her fingers along the
chain. &#8220;It is the very pattern I wished for,&#8221;
she whispered to her heart, &#8220;I remember drawing
it for him.&#8221; She did not hear Snorro&#8217;s
&#8220;good-by,&#8221; and he stood watching her curiously
a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said &#8216;good-by,&#8217; Margaret Vedder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; she answered mechanically. Her
whole soul was moved. She was in a maze of
tender, troubled thoughts, but Snorro perceived
nothing but her apparent interest in the jewels.
He could not forget his last sight of her standing,
so apparently calm, with her eyes fixed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
upon the locket and chain that dangled from
her white hand. &#8220;She was wondering how
much they cost Jan,&#8221; he thought bitterly;
&#8220;what a cold, cruel woman she is!&#8221;</p>
<p>That she had not asked him about his own
affairs, why he left so hurriedly, how he was
going, for what purpose, how long he was to be
away, was a part of her supreme selfishness,
Snorro thought. He could no longer come
into her life, and so she cared nothing about
him. He wished Dr. Balloch could have seen
her as he did, with poor Jan&#8217;s love-gifts in her
hands. With his heart all aflame on Jan&#8217;s
noble deeds, and his imagination almost deifying
the man, the man he loved so entirely,
Margaret&#8217;s behavior was not only very much
misunderstood by Snorro, it was severely and
unjustly condemned.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did God make women for?&#8221; he
asked angrily, as he strode back over the moor.
&#8220;I hope Jan has forgotten her, for it is little
she thinks of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>On reaching his home again he dressed himself
in his best clothes, for he could not sleep.
He walked up and down the old town, and
over the quays, and stood a five minutes before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
Peter Fae&#8217;s store, and so beguiled the hours
until he could go on board &#8220;The Lapwing.&#8221;</p>
<p>At five o&#8217;clock he saw Lord Lynne come
aboard, and the anchor was raised. Snorro
lifted his cap, and said, &#8220;Good morning, Lord
Lynne;&#8221; and my lord answered cheerily,
&#8220;Good morning, Snorro. With this wind we
shall make a quick passage to Wick.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br /><br />SNORRO AND JAN.</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;And yet when all is thought and said,</p>
<p>The heart still overrules the head;</p>
<p>Still what we hope, we must believe,</p>
<p>And what is given us receive.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Snorro had indeed very much misjudged
Margaret. During her interview with him
she had been absorbed in one effort, that of preserving
her self-control while he was present.
As soon as he had gone, she fled to her own
room, and locking the door, she fell upon her
knees. Jan&#8217;s last love-gifts lay on the bed
before her, and she bent her head over them,
covering them with tears and kisses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jan! Oh, my darling!&#8221; she whispered
to the deaf and dumb emblems of his affection.
&#8220;Oh, if thou could come back to me again!
Never more would I grieve thee, or frown on
thee! Never should thy wishes be unattended
to, or thy pleasure neglected! No one on earth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
no one should speak evil of thee to me! I
would stand by thee as I promised until death!
Oh, miserable, unworthy wife that I have been!
What shall I do? If now thou knew at last
how dearly Margaret loves thee, and how bitterly
she repents her blindness and her
cruelty!&#8221;</p>
<p>So she mourned in half-articulate sobbing
words, until little Jan awoke and called her.
Then she laid him in her own bed and sat down
beside him; quiet, but full of vague, drifting
thoughts that she could hardly catch, but which
she resolutely bent her mind to examine. Why
had Snorro kept these things so long, and then
that night suddenly brought them to her at
such a late hour? What was he going away
for? What was that strange light upon his
face? She had never seen such a look upon
Snorro&#8217;s face before. She let these questions
importune her all night, but she never dared put
into form the suspicion which lay dormant
below them, that Jan had something to do with
it; that Snorro had heard from Jan.</p>
<p>In the morning she took the trinkets with her
to Dr. Balloch&#8217;s. She laid them before him
one by one, telling when, and how, they had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
been offered and refused. &#8220;All but this,&#8221; she
said, bursting into childlike weeping, and showing
the battered, tarnished baby coral. &#8220;He
brought this for his child, and I would not let
him see the baby. Oh, can there be any mercy
for one so unmerciful as I was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daughter, weep; thy tears are gracious
tears. Would to God poor Jan could see thee
at this hour. Whatever happiness may now be
his lot, thy contrition would add to it, I know.
Go home to-day. No one is in any greater
trouble than thou art. Give to thyself tears
and prayers; it may be that ere long God will
comfort thee. And as thou goes, call at
Snorro&#8217;s house. See that the fire is out, lock
the door, and bring me the key when thou
comes to-morrow. I promised Snorro to care
for his property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where hath Snorro gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say to thee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That he was going to Wick. But how then
did he go? There was no steamer due.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Lynne took him in his yacht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is strange!&#8221; and Margaret looked
steadily at Dr. Balloch. &#8220;It seems to me, that
Lord Lynne&#8217;s yacht was at Lerwick, on that
night; thou knowest.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></div>
<p>&#8220;When Skager and Jan quarreled?&#8221;</p>
<p>She bowed her head, and continued to gaze
inquisitively at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thou art mistaken. On that night he
was far off on the Norway coast. It must have
been two weeks afterward, when he was in
<ins title='Added quote'>Lerwick.&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>&#8220;When will Lord Lynne be here again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know not; perhaps in a few weeks, perhaps
not until the end of summer. He may
not come again this year. He is more uncertain
than the weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret sighed, and gathering her treasures
together she went away. As she had been
desired, she called at Snorro&#8217;s house. The key
was on the outside of the door, she turned it,
and went in. The fire had been carefully extinguished,
and the books and simple treasures
he valued locked up in his wooden chest. It
had evidently been quite filled with these, for
his clothes hung against the wall of an inner
apartment. Before these clothes Margaret
stood in a kind of amazement. She was very
slow of thought, but gradually certain facts in
relation to them fixed themselves in her mind
with a conviction which no reasoning could
change.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>Snorro had gone away in his best clothes; his
fishing suit and his working suit he had left
behind. It was clear, then, that he had not gone
to the Wick fisheries; equally clear that he had
not gone away with any purpose of following
his occupation in loading and unloading vessels.
Why had he gone then? Margaret was
sure that he had no friends beyond the Shetlands.
Who was there in all the world that
could tempt Snorro from the little home he
had made and loved; and who, or what could
induce him to leave little Jan?</p>
<p><i>Only Jan&#8217;s father!</i></p>
<p>She came to this conclusion at last with a
clearness and rapidity that almost frightened
her. Her cheeks burned, her heart beat wildly,
and then a kind of anger took possession of
her. If Snorro knew any thing, Dr. Balloch
did also. Why was she kept in anxiety and
uncertainty? &#8220;I will be very quiet and watch,&#8221;
she thought, &#8220;and when Lord Lynne comes
again, I will follow him into the manse, and ask
him where my husband is.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she took a final look at Snorro&#8217;s belongings,
she thought pitifully, &#8220;How little he has!
And yet who was so good and helpful to every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
one? I might have taken more interest in his
housekeeping! How many little things I could
easily have added to his comforts! What a
selfish woman I must be! Little wonder that
he despised me!&#8221; And she determined that
hour to make Jan&#8217;s friend her friend when he
came back, and to look better after his household
pleasures and needs.</p>
<p>She had plenty now to think about, and she
was on the alert morning, noon, and night; but
nothing further transpired to feed her hope for
nearly a month. The fishing season was then
in full business, and Peter Fae, as usual, full of
its cares. There had been no formal reconciliation
between Margaret and her father and
stepmother, and there was no social intercourse
between the houses, but still they were on
apparent terms of friendship with each other.
The anger and ill-will had gradually worn away,
and both Peter and Suneva looked with respect
upon a woman so much in the minister&#8217;s favor
and company. Peter sent her frequent presents
from the store, and really looked upon his
handsome little grandson with longing and pride.
When he was a few years older he intended to
propose to pay for his education. &#8220;We&#8217;ll send
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
him to Edinburgh, Suneva,&#8221; he frequently said,
&#8220;and we will grudge nothing that is for his
welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Suneva, who had carefully fostered this
scheme, would reply, &#8220;That is what I have
always said, Peter. It is a poor family that has
not one gentleman in it, and, please God and
thy pocket-book, we will make a gentleman and
a minister of our little Jan;&#8221; and the thought
of his grandson filling a pulpit satisfied Peter&#8217;s
highest ambition.</p>
<p>So, though there had been no visiting between
the two houses, there were frequent tokens of
courtesy and good-will, and Margaret, passing
through the town, and seeing her father at his
shop-door, stopped to speak to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where hast thou been, and where is thy
boy?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is at home with Elga. I have been to
read with Mary Venn; she is failing fast, and
not long for this life.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they spoke Tulloch approached, and, with
a cold bow to Peter, turned to Margaret and
said, &#8220;I will walk with thee, Mistress Vedder,
as I have some business matter to speak of.&#8221;
Then, after they had turned to Margaret&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
home: &#8220;It was about the interest of the seven
hundred pounds placed to thy credit a few days
since. I will count the interest from the first
of the month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret was completely amazed. &#8220;Seven
hundred pounds!&#8221; she said, in a low trembling
voice. &#8220;I know nothing about it. Surely thou
art dreaming. Who brought it to thee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Balloch. He said it was conscience
money and not to be talked about. I suppose
thy father sent it, for it is well known that he
made his will a few days ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret, however, did not believe that it
was her father. She was sure Jan had sent the
money. It was her £600, with £100 for interest.
And oh, how it pained her! Somewhere on
earth Jan was alive, and he would neither come
to her, nor write to her. He sent her gold
instead of love, as if gold were all she wanted.
He could scarcely have contrived a more cruel
revenge, she thought. For once she absolutely
hated money; but it put into her mind a purpose
which would not leave it. If Snorro could
find Jan, she could. The money Jan had sent
she would use for that purpose.</p>
<p>She was cautious and suspicious by nature,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
and she determined to keep her intention close
in her own heart. All summer she watched
anxiously for the return of &#8220;The Lapwing,&#8221; but
it came not. One day, in the latter part of
August, Dr. Balloch asked her to answer for
him a letter which he had received from Lord
Lynne. She noted the address carefully. It
was in Hyde Park, London. Very well, she
would go to London. Perhaps she would be
nearer to Jan if she did.</p>
<p>She had now nearly £1,000 of her own. If
she spent every farthing of it in the search and
failed, she yet felt that she would be happier
for having made the effort. The scheme took
entire possession of her, and the difficulties in
the way of its accomplishment only made her
more stubbornly determined. The first, was
that of reaching the mainland without encountering
opposition. She was sure that both her
father and Dr. Balloch would endeavor to dissuade
her; she feared they would influence her
against her heart and judgment. After August,
the mail boats would be irregular and infrequent;
there was really not a day to be lost.</p>
<p>In the morning she went to see Tulloch. He
was eating his breakfast and he was not at all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
astonished to see her. He thought she had
come to talk to him about the investment of
her money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mistress Vedder! Thou
hast been much on my mind, thou and thy
money, and no doubt it is a matter of some
consequence what thou will do with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am come to speak to thee as a friend, in
whom I may confide a secret. Wilt thou hear,
and keep it, and give me good advice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not like to have to do with women&#8217;s
secrets, but thou art a woman by thyself. Tell
me all, then, but do not make more of the matter
than it is worth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When Jan Vedder had no other friend,
thou stood by him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What then? Jan was a good man. I say
that yet, and I say it to thy face, Margaret Vedder.
I think, too, that he had many wrongs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that too, and I shall be a miserable
woman until I have found Jan, and can tell him
to his face how sorry I am. So then, I am
going away to find him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What art thou talking of? Poor Jan is
dead. I am sure that is so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure it is not so. Now let me tell thee
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
all.&#8221; Then she went over the circumstances
which had fed her convictions, with a clearness
and certainty which brought conviction to
Tulloch&#8217;s mind also.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure thou are right,&#8221; he answered
gravely, &#8220;and I have nothing at all to say
against thy plan. It is a very good plan if it
has good management. Now, then, where will
thou go first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have Lord Lynne&#8217;s address in London.
I will go first of all to him. Jan sent me that
money, I am sure. It must have been a person
of wealth and power who helped him to make
such a sum, or he must have lent Jan the
money. I think this person was Lord
Lynne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that too. Now about thy money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will take it with me. Money in the pocket
is a ready friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it will be a great care to thee. The
best plan for thee is this: take fifty pounds in thy
pocket, and I will give thee a letter of credit
for the balance on a banking firm in London.
I will also write to them, and then, if thou wants
advice on any matter, or a friend in any case,
there they will be to help thee.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That is good. I will leave also with thee
twenty-five pounds for Elga. Thou art to pay
her five shillings every week. She will care for
my house until I return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And thy child?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will take him with me. If Jan is hard to
me, he may forgive me for the child&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Build not thy hopes too high. Jan had a
great heart, but men are men, and not God.
Jan may have forgotten thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have deserved to be forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may not desire to live with thee any
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he will only listen to me while I say, &#8216;I
am sorry with all my heart, Jan;&#8217; if he will
only forgive my unkindness to him, I shall count
the journey well made, though I go to the ends
of the earth to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God go with thee, and make all thy plans
to prosper. Here is the table of the mail boats.
One leaves next Saturday morning at six
o&#8217;clock. My advice is to take it. I will send
on Thursday afternoon for thy trunk, and Friday
night I will find some stranger fisher-boy to
take it to the boat. Come thou to my house
when all is quiet, and I will see thee safely on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
board. At six in the morning, when she sails,
the quay will be crowded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do all this. Speak not of the matter,
I ask thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou may fully trust me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Margaret went home with a light heart.
Her way had been made very plain to her; it
only now remained to bind Elga to her interest.
This was not hard to do. Elga promised to
remain for two years in charge of the house if
Margaret did not return before. She felt rich
with an allowance of five shillings a week, and
the knowledge that Banker Tulloch had authority
to prevent either Peter or Suneva from
troubling her during that time. So that it was
Elga&#8217;s interest, even if it had not been her will,
to give no information which might lead to the
breaking up of the comfort dependent on Margaret&#8217;s
absence.</p>
<p>Nothing interfered with Margaret&#8217;s plans.
During the three intervening days, she went as
usual to Dr. Balloch&#8217;s. Twice she tried to
introduce the subject of Snorro&#8217;s singular journey,
and each time she contrived to let the
minister see that she connected it in her own
mind with Jan. She noticed that on one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
these occasions, the doctor gave her a long,
searching look, and that the expression of
his own face was that of extreme indecision.
She almost thought that he was going to tell
her something, but he suddenly rose and
changed the subject of their conversation, in
a very decided manner. His reticence pained
and silenced her, for she almost longed to
open her heart to him. Yet, as he gave her
no encouragement, she was too shy, and perhaps
too proud to force upon him an evidently
undesired confidence. She determined, however,
to leave letters for him, and for her father,
stating the object of her voyage, but entering
into no particulars about it. These letters
she would put in Elga&#8217;s care, with orders not
to deliver them until Saturday night. By that
time Margaret Vedder hoped to be more than
a hundred miles beyond Lerwick.</p>
<p>In the meantime Snorro had reached Portsmouth,
his journey thither having been uneventful.
&#8220;The Retribution&#8221; had arrived two days
before, and was lying in dock. At the dock
office a letter which Lord Lynne had given
him, procured an admission to visit the ship,
and her tall tapering masts were politely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
pointed out to him. Snorro went with rapid
strides toward her, for it was near sunset and
he knew that after the gun had been fired,
there would be difficulty in getting on board.
He soon came to the ship of his desire. Her
crew were at their evening mess, only two or
three sailors were to be seen.</p>
<p>Snorro paused a moment, for he was trembling
with emotion, and as he stood he saw
three officers come from the cabin. They
grouped themselves on the quarter-deck, and
one of them, taller, and more splendidly dressed
than the others, turned, and seemed to look
directly at Snorro. The poor fellow stretched
out his arms, but his tongue was heavy, like
that of a man in a dream, and though he
knew it was Jan, he could not call him. He
had received at the office, however, a permit
to board &#8220;The Retribution&#8221; in order to speak
with her commander, and he found no difficulty
in reaching him.</p>
<p>Jan was still standing near the wheel talking
to his officers as Snorro approached. Now
that the moment so long watched and waited
for, had come, poor Snorro could hardly believe
it, and beside, he had seen in the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
glance at his friend, that this was a different
Jan somehow from the old one. It was not
alone his fine uniform, his sash and sword and
cocked hat; Jan had acquired an air of command,
an indisputable nobility and ease of
manner, and for a moment, Snorro doubted if
he had done well to come into his presence unannounced.</p>
<p>He stood with his cap in his hand waiting,
feeling heart-faint with anxiety. Then an officer
said some words to Jan, and he turned and
looked at Snorro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snorro! Snorro!&#8221;</p>
<p>The cry was clear and glad, and the next
moment Jan was clasping both his old friend&#8217;s
hands. As for Snorro, his look of devotion,
of admiration, of supreme happiness was enough.
It was touching beyond all words, and Jan felt
his eyes fill as he took his arm and led him
into his cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am come to thee, my captain. I would
have come, had thou been at the end of the
earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we will part no more, Snorro, we two.
Give me thy hand on that promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more, no more, my captain.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<p>&#8220;To thee, I am always &#8216;Jan.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My heart shall call thee &#8216;Jan,&#8217; but my lips
shall always say &#8216;my captain,&#8217; so glad are they to
say it! Shall I not sail with thee as long as we
two live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are mates for life, Snorro.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan sent his boy for bread and meat. &#8220;Thou
art hungry I know,&#8221; he said; &#8220;when did thou
eat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not since morning. To-day I was not
hungry, I thought only of seeing thee again.&#8221;</p>
<p>At first neither spoke of the subject nearest to
Jan&#8217;s heart. There was much to tell of
people long known to both men, but gradually
the conversation became slower and more
earnest, and then Snorro began to talk of Peter
Fae and his marriage. &#8220;It hath been a good
thing for Peter,&#8221; he said; &#8220;he looks by ten years
a younger man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Suneva, is she happy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, she dresses gayly, and gives
many fine parties, and is what she likes best of
all, the great lady of the town. But she hath
not a bad heart, and I think it was not altogether
her fault if thy wife was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If my wife was what, Snorro?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If thy wife was unhappy in her house. The
swan and the kittywake can not dwell in the
same nest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What hast thou to tell me of my wife and
son?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not such a boy as thy boy in all
Scotland. He is handsomer than thou art.
He is tall and strong, and lish and active as
a fish. He can dive and swim like a seal, he
can climb like a whaler&#8217;s boy, he can fling a
spear, and ride, and run, and read; and he was
beginning to write his letters on a slate when I
came away. Also, he was making a boat, for
he loves the sea, as thou loves it. Oh, I tell thee,
there is not another boy to marrow thy little Jan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he called Jan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he is called Jan after thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is great good news, Snorro. What
now of my wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>Snorro&#8217;s voice changed, and all the light left
his face. He spoke slowly, but with decision.
&#8220;She is a very good woman. There is not
a better woman to be found anywhere than
Margaret Vedder. The minister said I was to
tell thee how kind she is to all who are sick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
and in trouble, and to him she is as his right
hand. Yes, I will tell thee truly, that he thinks
she is worthy of thy love now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what dost thou think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think she is worthy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why dost thou not think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman may be an angel, and love thee
not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then thou thinks she loves me not? Why?
Has she other lovers? Tell me truly, Snorro.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man lives not in Lerwick who would
dare to speak a word of love to Margaret
Vedder. She walks apart from all merry-making,
and from all friends. As I have told
thee she lives in her own house, and enters
no other house but the manse, unless it be
to see some one in pain or sorrow. She is a
loving mother to thy son, but she loves not
thee. I will tell thee why I think.&#8221; Then
Snorro recounted with accurate truthfulness his
last interview with Margaret. He told Jan
every thing, for he had noted every thing:&mdash;her
dress, her attitude, her rising color, her interest
in the locket&#8217;s chain, her indifference as to his
own hurried journey, its object, or its length.</p>
<p>Jan heard all in silence, but the impression
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
made on him by Snorro&#8217;s recital, was not what
Snorro expected. Jan knew Margaret&#8217;s slow,
proud nature. He would have been astonished,
perhaps even a little suspicious of any exaggeration
of feeling, of tears, or of ejaculations.
Her interest in the locket chain said a great deal
to him. Sitting by his side, with her fair face
almost against his own, she had drawn the
pattern of the chain she wished. Evidently
she had remembered it; he understood that it
was her emotion at the recognition which had
made her so silent, and so oblivious of Snorro&#8217;s
affairs. The minister&#8217;s opinion had also great
weight with him. Dr. Balloch knew the whole
story of his wrong, knew just where he had
failed, and where Margaret had failed. If he
believed a reconciliation was now possible and
desirable, then Jan also was sure of it.</p>
<p>Snorro saw the purpose in his face. Perhaps
he had a moment&#8217;s jealous pang, but it was
instantly put down. He hastened to let Jan
feel that, even in this matter, he must always
be at one with him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust not to me,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it is little I
know or understand about women, and I may
judge Margaret Vedder far wrong.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I think thou does, Snorro. She was never
one to make a great show of her grief or her
regrets. But I will tell thee what she did when
thou wert gone away. In her own room, she
wept over that chain the whole night long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be. When little Jan had the
croup she was still and calm until the boy was
out of danger, and then she wept until my heart
ached for her. Only once besides have I seen
her weep; that was when Suneva accused her of
thy murder; then she took her baby in her
arms and came through the storm to me at the
store. Yes, she wept sorely that night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan sat with tightly-drawn lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it will make thee happy, send me back to
Lerwick, and I will bring thy wife and child
safely here. Thou would be proud indeed to
see them. The boy is all I have told thee. His
mother is ten times handsomer than when thou
married her. She is the fairest and most beautiful
of women. When she walks down the
street at the minister&#8217;s side, she is like no other
woman. Even Peter Fae is now proud that
she is his daughter, and he sends her of the
finest that comes to his hand. Shall I then go
for thee? Why not go thyself?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I will think about it, Snorro. I can not go
myself. I received my promotion yesterday,
and I asked to be transferred for immediate
service. I may get my orders any day. If I
send thee, I may have to sail without thee, and
yet not see my wife and child. No, I will not
part with thee, Snorro; thou art a certain gain,
and about the rest, I will think well. Now we
will say no more, for I am weary and weak; my
head aches also, and I fear I have fever again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day Jan was very ill, and it was
soon evident that typhoid fever of a long and
exhausting character had supervened on a condition
enfeebled by African malaria. For many
weeks he lay below the care of love or life, and
indeed it was August when he was able to get
on deck again. Then he longed for the open
sea, and so urged his desire, that he received an
immediate exchange to the ship Hydra, going
out to Borneo with assistance for Rajah Brooke,
who was waging an exterminating war against
the pirates of the Chinese and Indian seas.</p>
<p>The new ship was a very fine one, and Jan
was proud of his command. Snorro also had
been assigned to duty on her, having special
charge of a fine Lancaster gun which she carried,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
and no words could express his pride and
joy in his position. She was to sail on the 15th
day of August, one hour after noon, and early
in the morning of that day, Jan went off the
ship alone. He went direct to the Post Office,
and with trembling hands, for he was still very
weak, he dropped into it the following letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>My Dear Wife&mdash;My fair dear Margaret:</span></p>
<p>I have never ceased to love thee. Ask Dr. Balloch
to tell thee all. To-day I leave for the
Chinese sea. If thou wilt forgive and forget
the past, and take me again for thy husband,
have then a letter waiting for me at the Admiralty
Office, and when I return I will come to
Shetland for thee. Snorro is with me. He
hath told me all about thy goodness, and about
our little Jan. Do what thy heart tells thee to
do, and nothing else. Then there will be happiness.
Thy loving husband,</p>
<p class='sig1'><span class='smcap'>Jan Vedder.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few hours after this letter had been posted
Jan stood on his quarter deck with his face to
the open sea, and Snorro, in his new uniform,
elate with joy and pride, was issuing his first
orders to the quarter-master, and feeling that
even for him, life had really begun at last.</p>

</div></div>
<p>Margaret intended leaving Saturday,
but on Thursday night something happened,
the most unlooked-for thing that could
have happened to her&mdash;she received Jan&#8217;s letter.
As she was standing beside her packed trunk,
she heard Elga call:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here has come Sandy Bane with a letter,
Mistress Vedder, and he will give it to none but
thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not always that we have presentiments.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
That strange intelligence, that wraith of coming
events, does not speak, except a prescient soul
listens. Margaret attached no importance to
the call. Dr. Balloch often sent letters, she
supposed Sandy was waiting for a penny fee.
With her usual neatness, she put away some
trifles, locked her drawers, and then washed her
hands and face. Sandy was in no hurry either;
Elga had given him a cup of tea, and a toasted
barley-cake, and he was telling her bits of gossip
about the boats and fishers.</p>
<p>While they were talking, Margaret entered;
she gave Sandy a penny, and then with that
vague curiosity which is stirred by the sight of
almost any letter, she stretched out her hand
for the one he had brought. The moment she
saw it, she understood that something wonderful
had come to her. Quick as thought she
took in the significance of the official blue
paper and the scarlet seal. In those days, officers
in the Admiralty used imposing stationery, and
Jan had felt a certain pride in giving his few
earnest words the sanction of his honor and
office. Certainly it had a great effect upon
Margaret, although only those very familiar
with her, could have detected the storm of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
anxiety and love concealed beneath her calm
face and her few common words.</p>
<p>But oh, when she stood alone with Jan&#8217;s
loving letter in her hand, then all barriers were
swept away. The abandon of her slow, strong
nature, had in it an intensity impossible to
quicker and shallower affection. There was an
hour in which she forgot her mortality, when
her soul leaned and hearkened after Jan&#8217;s soul,
till it seemed not only possible, but positive,
that he had heard her passionate cry of love
and sorrow, and answered it. In that moment
of intense silence which succeeds intense feeling,
she was sure Jan called her. &#8220;<i>Margaret!</i>&#8221;
She heard the spiritual voice, soft, clear, sweeter
than the sweetest music, and many a soul that
in extremities has touched the heavenly horizon
will understand that she was not mistaken.</p>
<p>In an hour Tulloch sent for her trunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no trunk to be sent now; tell
Tulloch that Margaret Vedder will tell him the
why and the wherefore to-morrow.&#8221; Elga was
amazed, and somewhat disappointed, but Margaret&#8217;s
face astonished and subdued her, and
she did not dare to ask, &#8220;What then is the
matter?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>Margaret slept little that night. To the first
overwhelming personality of joy and sorrow,
there succeeded many other trains of thought.
It was evident that Dr. Balloch, perhaps Snorro
also, had known always of Jan&#8217;s life and doings.
She thought she had been deceived by both,
and not kindly used. She wondered how they
could see her suffer, year after year, the slow
torture of uncertainty, and unsatisfied love and
repentance. She quite forgot how jealously
she had guarded her own feelings, how silent
about her husband she had been, how resentful
of all allusion to him.</p>
<p>Throughout the night Elga heard her moving
about the house. She was restoring every
thing to its place again. The relief she felt in
this duty first revealed to her the real fear of
her soul at the strange world into which she
had resolved to go and seek her husband. She
had the joy of a child who had been sent a
message on some dark and terror-haunted way,
and had then been excused from the task. Even
as a girl the great outside world had rather terrified
than allured her. In her Edinburgh school
she had been homesick for the lonely, beautiful
islands, and nothing she had heard or read
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
since had made her wish to leave them. She
regarded Jan&#8217;s letter, coming just at that time,
as a special kindness of Providence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I am sure that is true,&#8221; said
Tulloch to her next morning. &#8220;Every one has
something to boast of now and then. Thou
canst say, &#8216;God has kept me out of the danger,
though doubtless He could have taken me
through it very safely.&#8217; And it will be much
to Jan&#8217;s mind, when he hears that it was thy
will to go and seek him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou wert ever kind to Jan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan had a good heart. I thought that
always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And thou thought right; how glad thou
will be to see him! Yes, I know thou wilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall see Jan no more, Margaret, for I am
going away soon, and I shall never come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Art thou sick, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I think; very. And I have seen one
who knows, and when I told him the truth, he
said to me, &#8216;Set thy house in order, Tulloch,
for it is likely this sickness will be thy last.&#8217;
So come in and out as often as thou can, Margaret,
and thou tell the minister the road I am
traveling, for I shall look to him and thee to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
keep me company on it as far as we may tread
it together.&#8221;</p>
<p>It did not enter Margaret&#8217;s mind to say little
commonplaces of negation. Her large, clear
eyes, solemn and tender, admitted the fact at
once, and she answered the lonely man&#8217;s petition
by laying her hand upon his, and saying,
&#8220;At this time thou lean on me like a daughter.
I will serve thee until the last hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When thou hast heard all concerning Jan
from the minister, come and tell me too; for
it will be a great pleasure to me to know how
Jan Vedder turned his trouble into good
fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>Probably Dr. Balloch had received a letter
from Jan also, for he looked singularly and
inquisitively at Margaret as she entered his
room. She went directly to his side, and laid
Jan&#8217;s letter before him. He read it slowly
through, then raised his face and said, &#8220;Well,
Margaret?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not so well. Thou knew all this time
that Jan was alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I knew it. It is likely to be so, for I&mdash;I
mean, I was sent to save his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilt thou tell me how?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will tell thee now. Little thou
thought in those days of Jan Vedder, but I will
show thee how God loved him! One of his holy
messengers, one of his consecrated servants,
one of this world&#8217;s nobles, were set to work together
for Jan&#8217;s salvation.&#8221; Then he told her
all that had happened, and he read her Jan&#8217;s
letters, and as he spoke of his great heart, and
his kind heart, the old man&#8217;s eyes kindled, and
he began to walk about the room in his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Such a tale Margaret had never heard before.
Tears of pity and tears of pride washed clean
and clear-seeing the eyes that had too often
wept only for herself. &#8220;Oh, Margaret! Margaret!&#8221;
he said, &#8220;learn this&mdash;when it is God&#8217;s
pleasure to save a man, the devil can not hinder,
nor a cruel wife, nor false friends, nor total
shipwreck, nor the murderer&#8217;s knife&mdash;all things
must work together for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If God gives Jan back to me, I will love
and honor him with all my heart and soul. I
promise thee I will that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See thou do. It will be thy privilege and
thy duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, why did thou not tell me all this before?
It would have been good for me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, it would have been bad for thee. Thou
has not suffered one hour longer than was necessary.
Week by week, month by month, year
by year, thy heart has been growing more
humble and tender, more just and unselfish;
but it was not until Snorro brought thee those
poor despised love-gifts of Jan&#8217;s that thou wast
humble and tender, and just, and unselfish
enough to leave all and go and seek thy lost
husband. But I am sure it was this way&mdash;the
very hour this gracious thought came into thy
heart thy captivity was turned. Now, then,
from thy own experience thou can understand
why God hides even a happy future from us.
If we knew surely that fame or prosperity or
happiness was coming, how haughty, how selfish,
how impatient we should be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like thee to go and tell my father
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell thee what thou must do&mdash;go home
and tell the great news thyself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not go into Suneva&#8217;s house. Thou
should not ask that of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the day of thy good fortune, be generous.
Suneva Fae has a kind heart, and I blame
thee much that there was trouble. Because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
God has forgiven thee, go without a grudging
thought, and say&mdash;&#8216;Suneva, I was wrong, and
I am sorry for the wrong; and I have good
news, and want my father and thee to share it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I can not do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no &#8216;can&#8217; in it. It is my will, Margaret,
that thou go. Go at once, and take
thy son with thee. The kind deed delayed is
worth very little. To-day that is thy work,
and we will not read or write. As for me, I
will loose my boat, and I will sail about the
bay, and round by the Troll Rock, and I will
think of these things only.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a few minutes Margaret stood watching
him drift with the tide, his boat rocking gently,
and the fresh wind blowing his long white hair,
and carrying far out to sea the solemnly joyful
notes to which he was singing his morning
psalm.</p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;Thou art a good man,&#8221; said Margaret to
herself, as she waved her hand in farewell, and
turned slowly homeward. Most women would
have been impatient to tell the great news that
had come to them, but Margaret could always
wait. Besides, she had been ordered to go to
Suneva with it, and the task was not a pleasant
one to her. She had never been in her father&#8217;s
house, since she left it with her son in her arms;
and it was not an easy thing for a woman so
proud to go and say to the woman who had
supplanted her&mdash;&#8220;I have done wrong, and I
am sorry for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet it did not enter her mind to disobey the
instructions given her; she only wanted time to
consider how to perform them in the quietest,
and least painful manner. She took the road
by the sea shore, and sat down on a huge barricade
of rocks. Generally such lonely communion
with sea and sky strengthened and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
calmed her; but this morning she could not
bring her mind into accord with it. Accidentally
she dislodged a piece of rock, and it fell
among the millions of birds sitting on the
shelving precipices below her. They flickered
with piercing cries in circles above her head,
and then dropped like a shower into the ocean,
with a noise like the hurrahing of an army.
Impatient and annoyed, she turned away from
the shore, across the undulating heathy plateau.
She longed to reach her own room; perhaps in
its seclusion she would find the composure she
needed.</p>
<p>As she approached her house, she saw a
crowd of boys and little Jan walking proudly in
front of them. One was playing &#8220;Miss Flora McDonald&#8217;s
reel&#8221; on a violin, and the gay strains
were accompanied by finger snappings, whistling,
and occasional shouts. &#8220;There is no
quiet to be found anywhere, this morning,&#8221;
thought Margaret, but her curiosity was aroused,
and she went toward the children. They saw
her coming, and with an accession of clamor
hastened to meet her. Little Jan carried a
faded, battered wreath of unrecognizable materials,
and he walked as proudly as Pompey may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
have walked in a Roman triumph. When
Margaret saw it, she knew well what had happened,
and she opened her arms, and held the
boy to her heart, and kissed him over and over,
and cried out, &#8220;Oh, my brave little Jan, brave
little Jan! How did it happen then? Thou
tell me quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hal Ragner shall tell thee, my mother;&#8221;
and Hal eagerly stepped forward:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was last night, Mistress Vedder, we were
all watching for the &#8216;Arctic Bounty;&#8217; but she
did not come, and this morning as we were
playing, the word was passed that she had
reached Peter Fae&#8217;s pier. Then we all ran, but
thou knowest that thy Jan runs like a red deer,
and so he got far ahead, and leaped on board,
and was climbing the mast first of all. Then
Bor Skade, he tried to climb over him, and
Nichol Sinclair, he tried to hold him back, but
the sailors shouted, &#8216;Bravo, little Jan Vedder!&#8217;
and the skipper he shouted &#8216;Bravo!&#8217; and thy
father, he shouted higher than all the rest. And
when Jan had cut loose the prize, he was like
to greet for joy, and he clapped his hands, and
kissed Jan, and he gave him five gold sovereigns,&mdash;see,
then, if he did not!&#8221; And little Jan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
proudly put his hand in his pocket, and held
them out in his small soiled palm.</p>
<p>The feat which little Jan had accomplished
is one which means all to the Shetland boy
that his first buffalo means to the Indian
youth. When a whaler is in Arctic seas, the
sailors on the first of May make a garland of
such bits of ribbons, love tokens, and keep-sakes,
as have each a private history, and this
they tie to the top of the main-mast. There it
swings, blow high or low, in sleet and hail,
until the ship reaches her home-port. Then
it is the supreme emulation of every lad, and
especially of every sailor&#8217;s son, to be first on
board and first up the mast to cut it down, and
the boy who does it, is the hero of the day, and
has won his footing on every Shetland boat.</p>
<p>What wonder, then, that Margaret was proud
and happy? What wonder that in her glow
of delight the thing she had been seeking was
made clear to her? How could she go better
to Suneva than with this crowd of happy
boys? If the minister thought she ought to
share one of her blessings with Suneva, she
would double her obedience, and ask her to
share the mother&#8217;s as well as the wife&#8217;s joy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>&#8220;One thing I wish, boys,&#8221; she said happily,
&#8220;let us go straight to Peter Fae&#8217;s house, for
Hal Ragner must tell Suneva Fae the good
news also.&#8221; So, with a shout, the little company
turned, and very soon Suneva, who was
busy salting some fish in the cellar of her
house, heard her name called by more than fifty
shrill voices, in fifty different keys.</p>
<p>She hurried up stairs, saying to herself, &#8220;It
will be good news, or great news that has come
to pass, no doubt; for when ill-luck has the day,
he does not call any one like that; he comes
sneaking in.&#8221; Her rosy face was full of smiles
when she opened the door, but when she saw
Margaret and Jan standing first of all, she was
for the moment too amazed to speak.</p>
<p>Margaret pointed to the wreath: &#8220;Our Jan
took it from the top-mast of the &#8216;Arctic
Bounty;&#8217;&#8221; she said. &#8220;The boys brought him
home to me, and I have brought him to thee,
Suneva. I thought thou would like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Jan!&#8221; In those two words Margaret
canceled every thing remembered against her.
Suneva&#8217;s eyes filled, and she stretched out
both her hands to her step-daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Margaret! Come in, my brave,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
darling Jan! Come in, boys, every one of
you! There is cake, and wheat bread, and
preserved fruit enough for you all; and I shall
find a shilling for every boy here, who has kept
Jan&#8217;s triumph with him.&#8221; And when Suneva
had feasted the children she brought a leather
pouch, and counting out £2 14s., sent them
away, fiddling and singing, and shouting with
delight.</p>
<p>But Margaret stayed; and the two women
talked their bitterness over to its very root.
For Suneva said: &#8220;We will leave nothing unexplained,
and nothing that is doubtful. Tell me
the worst thou hast thought, and the worst
thou hast heard, and what I can not excuse,
that I will say, &#8216;I am sorry for,&#8217; and thou wilt
forgive it, I know thou wilt.&#8221; And after this
admission, it was easy for Margaret also to say,
&#8220;I am sorry;&#8221; and when that part of the
matter had been settled, she added, &#8220;Now
then, Suneva, I have great good news to tell
thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>But with the words Peter and the minister
entered the house, and Margaret went to Dr.
Balloch and said, &#8220;I have done all thou bid
me; now then, thou tell my father and Suneva
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
whatever thou told me. That is what thou art
come for, I know it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is so. I was in the store when thy
little Jan and his companions came there with
the gold given them, and when the sovereigns
had been changed and every boy had got his
shilling, I said to thy father, &#8216;Come home with
me, for Margaret is at thy house, and great joy
has come to it to-day.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he told again the whole story, and read
aloud Jan&#8217;s letters; and Peter and Suneva were
so amazed and interested, that they begged the
minister to stay all day, and talk of the subject
with them. And the good man cheerfully consented,
for it delighted him to see Margaret
and Suneva busy together, making the dinner
and the tea, and sharing pleasantly the household
cares that women like to exercise for
those they love or respect. He looked at
them, and then he looked at Peter, and the
two men understood each other, without a
word.</p>
<p>By and by, little Jan, hungry and weary with
excitement, came seeking his mother, and his
presence added the last element of joy to the
reunited family. The child&#8217;s eager curiosity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
kept up until late the interest in the great
subject made known that day to Peter and
Suneva. For to Norsemen, slavery is the
greatest of all earthly ills, and Peter&#8217;s eyes
flashed with indignation, and he spoke of
Snorro not only with respect, but with something
also like a noble envy of his privileges.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had twenty years less, I would man a
ship of mine own, and go to the African coast
as a privateer, I would that. What a joy I
should give my two hands in freeing the
captives, and hanging those slavers in a slack
rope at the yard-arm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, Peter, thou would not be brutal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I would be a brute with brutes; that
is so, my minister. Even St. James thinks as
I do&mdash;&#8216;He shall have judgment without mercy
that showeth no mercy.&#8217; That is a good way,
I think. I am glad Snorro hath gone to look
after them. I would be right glad if he had
Thor&#8217;s hammer in his big hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hath a Lancaster gun, Peter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is not like seeing the knife redden
in the hand. Oh, no!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter, we are Christians, and not heathens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry if the words grieve thee. Often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
I have wondered why David wrote some of
the hard words he did write. I wonder no
more. He wrote them against the men who
sell human life for gold. If I was Jan Vedder,
I would read those words every morning to my
men. The knife that is sharpened on the word
of God, cuts deep&mdash;that is so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan hath done his part well, Peter, and I
wish that he could see us this night. It hath
been a day of blessing to this house, and I am
right happy to have been counted in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he went away, but that night Margaret
and her son once more slept in their old room
under Peter Fae&#8217;s roof. It affected her to see
that nothing had been changed. A pair of
slippers she had forgotten still stood by the
hearthstone. Her mother&#8217;s Bible had been
placed upon her dressing table. The geranium
she had planted, was still in the window; it
had been watered and cared for, and had grown
to be a large and luxuriant plant. She thought
of the last day she had occupied that room, and
of the many bitter hours she had spent in it,
and she contrasted them with the joy and the
hope of her return.</p>
<p>But when we say to ourselves, &#8220;I will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
grateful,&#8221; it is very seldom the heart consents
to our determination; and Margaret, exhausted
with emotion, was almost shocked to find that
she could not realize, with any degree of
warmth, the mercy and blessing that had come
to her. She was the more dissatisfied, because
as soon as she was alone she remembered the
message Tulloch had given her. It had
remained all day undelivered, and quite forgotten.
&#8220;How selfish I am,&#8221; she said wearily,
but ere she could feel sensibly any regret for
her fault she had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>In the morning it was her first thought, and
as soon after breakfast as possible she went to
Dr. Balloch&#8217;s. He seemed shocked at the
news, and very much affected. &#8220;We have
been true friends for fifty years, Margaret,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;I never thought of his being ill, of his
dying&mdash;dying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He does not appear to fear death, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he will meet it as a good man should.
He knows well that death is only the veil which
we who live call life. We sleep, and it is
lifted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wilt thou see him to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, this morning. Thirty-eight years ago
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
this month his wife died. It was a great grief
to him. She was but a girl, and her bride-year
was not quite worn out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never heard of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, that is like to be. This is the
first time I have spoken of Nanna Tulloch since
she went away from us. It is long to remember,
yet she was very lovely, and very much
beloved. But thou knowest Shetlanders speak
not of the dead, nor do they count any thing
from a day of sorrow. However, thy words
have brought many things to my heart. This
day I will spend with my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reconciliation which had taken place was
a good thing for Margaret. She was inclined
to be despondent; Suneva always faced the
future with a smile. It was better also that
Margaret should talk of Jan, than brood over
the subject in her own heart; and nothing
interested Suneva like a love-quarrel. If it
were between husband and wife, then it was of
double importance to her. She was always trying
to put sixes and sevens at one. She persuaded
Margaret to write without delay to Jan,
and to request the Admiralty Office to forward
the letter. If it had been her letter she would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
have written &#8220;Haste&#8221; and &#8220;Important&#8221; all
over it. She never tired of calculating the possibilities
of Jan receiving it by a certain date,
and she soon fixed upon another date, when,
allowing for all possible detentions, Jan&#8217;s next
letter might be expected.</p>
<p>But perhaps, most of all, the reconciliation was
good for Peter. Nothing keeps a man so
young as the companionship of his children and
grandchildren. Peter was fond and proud of
his daughter, but he delighted in little Jan.
The boy, so physically like his father, had many
of Peter&#8217;s tastes and peculiarities. He loved
money, and Peter respected him for loving it.
There were two men whom Peter particularly
disliked; little Jan disliked them also with all
his childish soul, and when he said things about
them that Peter did not care to say, the boy&#8217;s
candor charmed and satisfied him, although he
pretended to reprove it.</p>
<p>Jan, too, had a very high temper, and resented,
quick as a flash, any wound to his childish self-esteem.
Peter was fond of noticing its relationship
to his own. One day he said to the boy:
&#8220;Do that again and I will send thee out of the
store.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If thou sends me out just once, I will never
come in thy store again; no, I will not; never,
as long as I live,&#8221; was the instant retort.
Peter repeated it to Suneva with infinite pride
and approval. &#8220;No one will put our little Jan
out for nothing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, he is just like thee!&#8221; said the
politic Suneva; and Peter&#8217;s face showed that
he considered the resemblance as very complimentary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br /><br />JAN&#8217;S RETURN.</h2>
</div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;For them the rod of chastisement flowered.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>A stranger suddenly dropped in these
Shetland islands, especially in winter,
would not unnaturally say, &#8220;how monotonously
dreary life must be here! In such isolation the
heart must lose its keen sense of sympathy, and
be irresponsive and dumb.&#8221; That is the great
mistake about the affections. It is not the rise
and fall of empires, the birth and death of
kings, or the marching of armies that move
them most. When they answer from their
depths, it is to the domestic joys and tragedies
of life. Ever since Eve wept over her slain
son, and Rebecca took the love-gifts of Isaac,
this has been the case; and until that mighty
angel, who stands on the sea and land, cries,
&#8220;Time shall be no more,&#8221; the home loves, and
the home trials, will be the center of humanity&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
deepest and sweetest emotions. So, then,
the little Shetland town had in it all the elements
necessary for a life full of interest&mdash;birth
and death, love and sorrow, the cruel hand and
the generous hand, the house of mourning and
the house of joy.</p>
<p>Just before Christmas-tide, Tulloch was sitting
alone at midnight. His malady was too
distressing to allow him to sleep, but a Norseman
scorns to complain of physical suffering,
and prefers, so long as it is possible, to carry
on the regular routine of his life. He was
unable to go much out, and his wasted body
showed that it was under a constant torture,
but he said nothing, only he welcomed Margaret
and the doctor warmly, and seemed to
be glad of their unspoken sympathy. It had
been stormy all day, but the wind had gone
down, and a pale moon glimmered above the
dim, tumbling sea. All was quiet, not a footfall,
not a sound except the dull roar of the
waves breaking upon the beach.</p>
<p>Suddenly a woman&#8217;s sharp cry cut the silence
like a knife. It was followed by sobs and
shrieks and passing footsteps and the clamor
of many voices. Every one must have noticed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
how much more terrible noises are at night
than in the daytime; the silly laughter of
drunkards and fools, the maniac&#8217;s shout, the
piercing shriek of a woman in distress, seem to
desecrate its peaceful gloom, and mock the
slow, mystic panorama of the heavens. Tulloch
felt unusually impressed by this night-tumult,
and early in the morning sent his servant
out to discover its meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Maggie Barefoot, sir; her man was
drowned last night; she has six bairns and not
a bread-winner among them. But what then?
Magnus Tulloch went too, and he had four
little lads&mdash;their mother died at Lammas-tide.
They&#8217;ll be God&#8217;s bairns now, for they have
neither kith nor kin. It is a sad business, I
say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and bring them here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The order was given without consideration,
and without any conscious intention. He was
amazed himself when he had uttered it. The
man was an old servant, and said hesitatingly,
&#8220;Yes, but they are no kin of thine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the apples on the same tree have come
from the same root, Bele; and it is like enough
that all the Tullochs will have had one forbear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
I would be a poor Tulloch to see one of the
name wanting a bite and sup. Yes, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was very thoughtful after seeing the
children, and when Dr. Balloch came, he said
to him at once: &#8220;Now, then, I will do what
thou hast told me to do&mdash;settle up my affairs
with this world forever. Wilt thou help me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I think thou does the right thing, I will
help thee, but I do not think it is right to give
thy money to Margaret Vedder. She has
enough and to spare. &#8216;Cursed be he that
giveth unto the rich.&#8217; It was Mahomet and
Anti-Christ that said the words, but for all that
they are good words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no kin but a fifth cousin in Leith;
he is full of gold and honor. All that I have
would be a bawbee to him. But this is what I
think, my money is Shetland money, made of
Shetland fishers, and it ought to stay in Shetland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, we are of one mind so far. Now
my wish is to be bread-giver even when I am
dead, to be bread-giver to the children whose
fathers God has taken. Here are Magnus
Tulloch&#8217;s four, and Hugh Petrie&#8217;s little lad, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
James Traill&#8217;s five children, and many more of
whom I know not. My houses, big and little,
shall be homes for them. My money shall buy
them meal and meat and wadmall to clothe
them. There are poor lonely women who will
be glad to care for them, eight or ten to each,
and Suneva Fae and Margaret Vedder will see
that the women do their duty. What thinkest
thou?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, I think this, that God has made
thy will for thee. Moreover, thou hast put a
good thought into my heart also. Thou knows
I brought in my hand a little money when I
came to Shetland, and it has grown, I know not
how. I will put mine with thine, and though
we are two childless old men, many children
shall grow up and bless us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Into this scheme Tulloch threw all his
strength and foresight and prudence. The
matter was urgent, and there were no delays,
and no waste of money. Three comfortable
fishermen&#8217;s cottages that happened to be
vacant, were fitted with little bunks, and plenty
of fleeces for bedding. Peat was stacked for
firing, and meal and salted fish sent in; so that
in three days twenty-three fatherless, motherless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
children were in warm, comfortable
homes.</p>
<p>Suneva entered into the work with perfect
delight. She selected the mothers for each
cottage, and she took good care that they kept
them clean and warm, that the little ones&#8217; food
was properly cooked, and their clothes washed
and mended. If there were a sorrow or a complaint
it was brought to her, and Suneva was
not one to blame readily a child.</p>
<p>Never man went down to the grave with his
hands so full of beneficent work as Tulloch.
Through it he took the sacrament of pain almost
joyfully, and often in the long, lonely hours of
nightly suffering, he remembered with a smile
of pleasure, the little children sweetly sleeping
in the homes he had provided for them. The
work grew and prospered wonderfully; never
had there been a busier, happier winter in Lerwick.
As was customary, there were tea-parties
at Suneva&#8217;s and elsewhere nearly every night,
and at them the women sewed for the children,
while the men played the violin, or recited from
the Sagas, or sung the plaintive songs of the
Islands.</p>
<p>Margaret brought the dying man constant
intelligence of his bounty: the children, one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
or two at a time, were allowed to come and see
him; twice, leaning on Dr. Balloch, and his servant
Bele, he visited the homes, and saw the
orphans at their noonday meals. He felt the
clasp of grateful hands, and the kiss of baby
lips that could not speak their thanks. His
last was the flower of his life-work and he saw
the budding of it, and was satisfied with its
beauty.</p>
<p>One morning in the following April, Margaret
received the letter which Suneva had prophesied
would arrive by the twentieth, if the weather
were favorable. Nowhere in the world has the
term, &#8220;weather permitting,&#8221; such significance as
in these stormy seas. It is only necessary to
look at the mail steamers, so strongly built, so
bluff at the bows, and nearly as broad as they
are long, to understand that they expect to
have to take plenty of hard blows and buffetings.
It was the first steamer that had arrived
for months, and though it made the harbor in
a blinding snow-storm, little Jan would not be
prevented from going into the town to see if it
brought a letter. For the boy&#8217;s dream of every
thing grand and noble centered in his father.
He talked of him incessantly; he longed to see
him with all his heart.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>Margaret also was restless and faint with
anxiety; she could not even knit. Never were
two hours of such interminable length. At last
she saw him coming, his head bent to the storm,
his fleet feet skimming the white ground, his
hands deep in his pockets. Far off, he discovered
his mother watching for him; then he
stopped a moment, waved the letter above his
head, and hurried onward. It was a good letter,
a tender, generous, noble letter, full of love
and longing, and yet alive with the stirring story
of right trampling wrong under foot. The child
listened to it with a glowing face:</p>
<p>&#8220;I would I were with my father and Snorro,&#8221;
he said, regretfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would thou then leave me, Jan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I would leave thee, mother. I would
leave thee, and love thee, as my father does. I
could stand by my father&#8217;s side, I could fire a
gun, or reef a sail, as well as Snorro. I would
not be afraid of any thing; no, I would not.
It is such a long, long time till a boy grows
up to be a man! When I am a man, thou
shall see that I will have a ship of my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is only in sorrow bad weather masters us;
in joy we face the storm and defy it. Margaret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
never thought of the snow as any impediment.
She went first to Suneva, and then to
Dr. Balloch with her letter; and she was so
full of happiness that she did not notice the
minister was very silent and preoccupied.
After a little, he said, &#8220;Margaret, I must go
now to Tulloch; it has come to the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I think he will be glad. He has
suffered long and sorely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet a little while ago he was full of life,
eager for money, impatient of all who opposed
him. Thou knowest how hard it often was to
keep peace between him and thy father. Now
he has forgotten the things that once so
pleased him; his gold, his houses, his boats,
his business, have dropped from his heart,
as the toys drop from the hand of a sleepy
child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father went to see him a week ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is perfect peace between them now.
Thy father kissed him when they said &#8216;good-by.&#8217;
When they meet again, they will have forgotten
all the bitterness, they will remember
only that they lived in the same town, and worshiped
in the same church, and were companions
in the same life. This morning we are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
going to eat together the holy bread; come
thou with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they walked through the town the minister
spoke to a group of fishers, and four from
among them silently followed him. Tulloch
was still in his chair, and his three servants
stood beside him. The table was spread, the
bread was broken, and, with prayers and tears,
the little company ate it together. Then they
bade each other farewell, a farewell tranquil and
a little sad&mdash;said simply, and without much
speaking. Soon afterward Tulloch closed his
eyes and the minister and Margaret watched
silently beside him. Only once again the dying
man spoke. He appeared to be sleeping
heavily, but his lips suddenly moved and he
said: &#8220;We shall see Nanna to-morrow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We!&#8221; whispered Margaret. &#8220;Whom does
he mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One whom we can not see; one who knows
the constellations, and has come to take him to
his God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just at sunset a flash of strange light transfigured
for a moment the pallor of his face; he
opened wide his blue eyes, and standing erect,
bowed his head in an untranslatable wonder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
and joy. It was the moment of release, and
the weary body fell backward, deserted and
dead, into the minister&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>During the few months previous to his death,
Tulloch had been much in every one&#8217;s heart and
on every one&#8217;s tongue. There had not been a
gathering of any kind in which his name had
not been the prominent one; in some way or
other, he had come into many lives. His death
made a general mourning, especially among the
fishers, to whom he had ever been a wise and
trustworthy friend. He had chosen his grave
in a small islet half a mile distant from Lerwick&mdash;a
lonely spot where the living never went,
save to bury the dead.</p>
<p>The day of burial was a clear one, with a
salt, fresh wind from the south-west. Six fishermen
made a bier of their oars, and laid the
coffin upon it. Then the multitude followed,
singing as they went, until the pier was reached.
Boat after boat was filled, and the strange procession
kept a little behind the one bearing the
coffin and the minister. The snow lay white
and unbroken on the island, and, as it was only
a few acres in extent, the sea murmured unceasingly
around all its shores.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></div>
<p>The spot was under a great rock carved by
storms into cloud-like castles and bastions.
Eagles watched them with icy gray eyes from
its summit, and the slow cormorant, and the sad
sea-gulls. Overhead a great flock of wild swans
were taking their majestic flight to the solitary
lakes of Iceland, uttering all the time an inspiring
cry, the very essence of eager expectation
and of joyful encouragement. Dr. Balloch
stood, with bared head and uplifted eyes,
watching them, while they laid the mortal part
of his old friend in &#8220;that narrow house, whose
mark is one gray stone.&#8221; Then looking around
on the white earth, and the black sea, and the
roughly-clad, sad-faced fishers, he said, almost
triumphantly&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The message came forth from him in whom
we live, and move, and have our being:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is nearer to us than breathing, and
closer than hands or feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up hither and dwell in the house of
the Lord forever.</p>
<p>&#8220;The days of thy sorrow have been sufficient;
henceforward there is laid up for thee
the reward of exceeding joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou shalt no more fear the evil to come;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
the bands of suffering are loosed. Thy Redeemer
hath brought thee a release from sorrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;So he went forth unto his Maker; he
attained unto the beginning of peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;He departed to the habitations of just men
made perfect, to the communion of saints, to
the life everlasting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he threw a few spadefuls of earth into
the grave, and every man in turn did the same,
till the sepulture was fully over. Silently then
the boats filled, and all went to their homes.
They were solemn, but not sorrowful. The
simple, pathetic service left behind it a feeling
as of triumph. It had shown them they were
mortal, but assured them also of immortality.</p>
<p>During the following summer Margaret
received many letters from Jan; and she wrote
many to him. Nothing is so conducive to a
strong affection as a long sweet course of love-letters,
and both of them impressed their souls
on the white paper which bore to each other
their messages of affection. It was really their
wooing time, and never lover was half so
impatient to claim his bride, as Jan was to see
again his fair, sweet Margaret. But it was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
likely that he could return for another year, and
Margaret set herself to pass the time as wisely
and happily as possible.</p>
<p>Nor did she feel life to be a dreary or monotonous
affair. She was far too busy for morbid
regrets or longings, for ennui, or impatience.
Between Dr. Balloch, little Jan, the &#8220;Tulloch
Homes,&#8221; and her own house, the days were far
too short. They slipped quickly into weeks,
and the weeks into months, and the months
grew to a year, and then every morning she
awoke with the same thought&mdash;&#8220;Even to-day
Jan might come.&#8221; Little Jan shared her joyous
expectations. He was always watching the
horizon for any strange-looking craft. The last
thing at night, the first in the morning, sometimes
during the night, he scanned the bay,
which was now filling fast with fishing boats
from all quarters.</p>
<p>One Sunday morning very, very early, he
came to his mother&#8217;s bedside. &#8220;Wake, my
mother! There is a strange ship in the bay.
She is coming straight to harbor. Oh! I feel
surely in my heart, that it is my father&#8217;s ship!
Let me go. Let me go now, I ask thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret was at the window ere the child
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
ceased speaking. &#8220;Thou may go,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;for I certainly think it is &#8216;The Lapwing.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>He had fled at the first words, and Margaret
awoke Elga, and the fires were kindled, and the
breakfast prepared, and the happy wife dressed
herself in the pale blue color that Jan loved;
and she smiled gladly to see how beautifully it
contrasted with the golden-brown of her hair,
and the delicate pink in her cheeks.</p>
<p>As for the child, his clear, sharp eyes soon
saw very plainly that the vessel had come to
anchor in the bay. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that will
be because the tide does not serve yet.&#8221; John
Semple, an old Scot from Ayrshire, was on the
pier, the only soul in sight. &#8220;John, thou loose
the boat, and row me out to &#8216;The Lapwing.&#8217; It
is &#8216;The Lapwing.&#8217; I know it is. Come, thou
must be in a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hurry&#8217; is the deil&#8217;s ain word, and I&#8217;ll
hurry for naebody; forbye, I wadna lift an oar
for man nor bairn on the Sawbath day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dost thou think it is &#8216;The Lapwing?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be: I&#8217;ll no say it isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>The child had unfastened the boat while he
was talking; he leaped into it, and lifted an
oar. &#8220;Then I must scull, John. Thou might
go with me!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no gaun to break the Sawbath, an&#8217; a
water way is waur than a land way, for then
you&#8217;ll be atween the deil an&#8217; the deep sea.
Bide at hame, Jan, an&#8217; ye&#8217;ll be a wise lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan shook his head, and went away by himself.
The bay was smooth as glass, and he
paddled with marvelous ease and speed. Very
soon he came alongside the yacht: the sailors
were holystoning the deck, but there was not a
face looked over the side that little Jan knew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, is this &#8216;The Lapwing?&#8217;&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s her name; what&#8217;s your name, you
little monkey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan Vedder. Throw me a rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men laughed as if at some excellent
joke, and taunted and teased the child until he
was in a passion. In the middle of the quarrel
Jan himself came on deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lad as wants to come on board, Captain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan looked down at the lad who wanted to
come on board, and the bright, eager face gave
him a sudden suspicion. &#8220;What is thy name?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan Vedder. Wilt thou throw me a rope?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the captain turned and gave some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
orders, and in a few minutes little Jan stood on
the deck of &#8220;The Lapwing.&#8221; His first glance, his
first movement was toward the handsomely
dressed officer who was watching him with such
a smiling, loving face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou art my father! I know thou art!&#8221;
and with the words he lifted up his face and
arms as if to be kissed and embraced.</p>
<p>Then they went into the cabin and Snorro
was called, and perhaps Jan had a little pang
of jealousy when he witnessed the joy of the
child, and saw him folded to Snorro&#8217;s big heart.
Jan and Snorro were already dressed in their
finest uniforms. They had only been waiting
for the daybreak to row into harbor. But now
there was no need of delay. &#8220;My mother is
waiting for thee,&#8221; said little Jan, anxiously.
&#8220;Come, let us go to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was still very early. John Semple had
disappeared, and not a soul else was stirring.
But this time when Jan approached his old
home, the welcome was evident from afar. The
chimneys were smoking, the blinds raised, the
door wide open, and Margaret, beautiful and
loving, stood in it, with beaming face and open
arms to welcome him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></div>
<p>Then there was a wonderful breakfast, and
they sat over it until the bells were ringing for
church. &#8220;There will be time to talk afterward,&#8221;
said Snorro, &#8220;but now, what better thing can
be done than to go to church? It will be the
best place of all, and it is well said, &#8216;for a happy
hour a holy roof.&#8217; What dost thou think,
Jan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think as thou dost, and I see the same
answer in my Margaret&#8217;s face. Well, then, we
will take that road.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Jan, with his wife upon his arm, went first,
and Snorro, holding little Jan by the hand,
followed. The congregation were singing a
psalm, a joyful one, it seemed to Jan, and they
quietly walked to the minister&#8217;s pew, which was
always reserved for strangers.</p>
<p>Ere they reached it there was a profound
sensation, and Dr. Balloch slightly raised himself
and looked at the party. Jan was in his
full uniform, and so was Snorro, but there was
no mistaking either of the men. And no mistaking
the tone of the service which followed!
It seemed as if the minister had flung off fifty
years, and was again talking to his flock with
the fire and enthusiasm of his youth. His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
prayer was like a song of triumph; his sermon,
the old joyful invitation of the heart that had
found its lost treasure, and called upon its
neighbors to come and rejoice with it. The
service ended in a song that was a benediction,
and a benediction that was a song.</p>
<p>Then Dr. Balloch hastened to come down,
and Jan, seeing how he trembled with joy, went
to meet and support him; and so there, even
on the pulpit stairs, the good minister kissed
and blessed him, and called him, &#8220;my dear
son.&#8221; Peter put out both hands to Jan, and
Margaret embraced Suneva, and in the church-yard
the whole congregation waited, and there
was scarcely a dry eye among either men or
women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou come home to my house to-night,
Jan,&#8221; said Peter, &#8220;thou, and thy wife and child;
come, and be gladly welcome, for this is a great
day to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, all of you,&#8221; said Suneva, &#8220;and Snorro,
he must come too.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they spent the night at Peter&#8217;s house, and
the next morning Peter walked to his store
between his son-in-law and his grandson, the
proudest and happiest man in Shetland. All,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
and far more than all of his old love for Jan had
come back to his heart. Jan could have asked
him now for the half of his fortune, and it
would have been given cheerfully.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br /><br />LABOR AND REST.</h2>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Turning to the celestial city, to infinite serenities, to love
without limit, to perfect joy.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next evening Peter and Suneva and
Dr. Balloch sat around Jan&#8217;s hearth, and
talked of all that he had seen and done during
his absence. &#8220;But where is Michael Snorro?&#8221;
asked the doctor. &#8220;I thought to have heard
him talk to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snorro stays by the yacht. His quarters
are on her, and she is in his charge. No one
finds Snorro far from the post of duty,&#8221; answered
Jan proudly. &#8220;He is the best sailor in
her Majesty&#8217;s service, and the best fighter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is likely,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;Since the
days of Harold Halfager, the Snorros have
been called good fighters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not?&#8221; asked Suneva, with a
proud toss of her handsome head. &#8220;He is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
pure Norse. Will a Norseman turn from any
fight in a good cause? That he will not
Peter, there is none can tell us better what the
Norseman is than thou can. Speak out now,
for Jan and the minister will be glad to hear
<ins title='Added quote'>thee.&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>Every Shetlander can recite. Suneva had
taught Peter to believe that no one could
recite as well as he could; so he laid down his
pipe, and, with great spirit and enthusiasm,
spoke thus:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>

<p>A man who&#8217;ll face to his last breath</p>

<p>From his rude breast a babe can press</p>

<p>Make his eyes water, his heart dance,</p>
<p>And sunrise in his countenance;</p>
<p class='indent8'>The mild, great-hearted Norseman.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Valiant and true, as Sagas tell,</p>
<p>The Norseman hateth lies like hell;</p>
<p>Hardy from cradle to the grave,</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis his religion to be brave;</p>
<p>Great, silent, fighting men, whose words</p>
<p>Were few, soon said, and out with swords!</p>
<p>One saw his heart cut from his side</p>
<p>Living&mdash;and smiled, and smiling, died,</p>
<p class='indent8'>The unconquerable Norseman!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>Still in our race the Norse king reigns,</p>
<p>His best blood beats along our veins;</p>
<p>With his old glory we can glow,</p>
<p>And surely sail where he could row.</p>
<p>Is danger stirring? Up from sleep</p>
<p>Our war-dog wakes the watch to keep,</p>
<p>Stands with our banner over him,</p>
<p>True as of old, and stern and grim;</p>
<p class='indent8'>The brave, true-hearted Norseman.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>When swords are gleaming you shall see</p>
<p>The Norseman&#8217;s face flash gloriously;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<p>With look that makes the foeman reel:</p>
<p>His mirror from of old was steel.</p>
<p>And still he wields, in battle&#8217;s hour,</p>
<p>That old Thor&#8217;s hammer of Norse power;</p>
<p>Strikes with a desperate arm of might,</p>
<p>And at the last tug turns the fight:</p>
<p class='indent8'>For never yields the Norseman.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;That is true,&#8221; said Jan; &#8220;and Snorro knows
not the way to yield. Once, on the river
Songibusar, when we were attacking Sherif
Osman, there was danger that a battery would
be taken in reverse. &#8216;The Ajax&#8217; had come up to
assist the &#8216;Hydra,&#8217; and her commander sent a
sergeant to tell Snorro that he had better spike
his gun and retreat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suneva laughed scornfully, and asked, &#8220;Well,
then, what did Snorro answer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Thou tell him that sent thee, that Michael
Snorro takes his orders only from Captain Jan
Vedder, and Captain Vedder has not said
&#8220;retreat.&#8221; No, indeed!&#8217; Then he got his
gun round to bear on the enemy, and he poured
such a fire down on them that they fled, fled
quick enough. As for Snorro, he did things
almost impossible.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jan, Osman was a very bad man. It
is not well to pity the downfall of tyrants. He
had made Borneo, it seems, a hell upon earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My minister, he was a devil and no man.
But five hundred free blue jackets were more
than he could bear. We utterly destroyed all
his forts, and took all his cannon, and made the
coast habitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day,&#8221; said Margaret, &#8220;I heard thee say
to Snorro, &#8216;when thou comes next on shore,
bring with thee that idol of Chappo&#8217;s for the
minister.&#8217; Who then is Chappo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A wretch worth fighting. A Chinese pirate
who came out against us with forty junks, each
junk carrying ten guns and a crew of fifty men.
He had been blockading the island of Potoo,
where many English ladies had taken refuge.
It is not fit to name the deeds of these devils.
We took from them sixty wretched captives,
destroyed one hundred of their crafts and two
hundred of their guns, and thus enabled a large
number of merchant vessels which had been shut
up in different rivers for ransom, to escape.
There was even a worse state of affairs on the
Sarabas. There we were assisted by an American
ship called &#8216;The Manhattan,&#8217; and with her aid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
destroyed a piratical expedition numbering one
hundred and twenty proas carrying more than
twelve hundred men. These wretches before
starting beheaded and mutilated all their women
captives, and left their bodies with that of a
child about six years old upon the beach.
Snorro&#8217;s wrath that day was terrible. He shut
his ears to every cry for mercy. I do not blame
him; indeed, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus they talked, until the minister said,
&#8220;Now I must go to my own house, for Hamish
is full of fears for me if I am late.&#8221; So Jan
walked with him. It was midnight, but the
moon was high in the zenith, and the larks
singing rapturously in mid-air. A tender,
mystical glow was over earth and sea, and both
were as still as if they were a picture. Many
good words were said on that walk, and the
man who was saved and the man who saved
him both lay down upon their beds that night
with full and thankful hearts.</p>
<p>For two months, full of quiet joy, Jan and
Margaret occupied their old home. They were
almost as much alone as in their honeymoon;
for little Jan spent most of his time with his
friend Snorro, on board &#8220;The Lapwing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
Snorro had been much pleased to join his old
mates in the fishing boats, but he could not
bear to put off, even for a day, his uniform.
However, Jan and he and little Jan often
sailed in advance of the fleet, and found the
herring, and brought word back what course to
steer. For this knowledge was a kind of
instinct with Jan; he could stand and look
east and west, north and south, and then by
some occult premonition, strike the belt of
fish.</p>
<p>Never had Jan dreamed of such happiness as
came at last to him in that humble home of
his early married life. It was a late harvest of
joy, but it was a sure one. Margaret had wept
tears of fond regret in all its rooms; its hearth
had been an altar of perpetual repentance to
her. But the sorrow had been followed by the
joy of forgiveness, and the bliss of re-union.
Its walls now echoed the fond words of mutual
trust and affection, and the hearty communings
of friendship. There was no stint in its hospitality;
no worry over trivial matters. Margaret
had learned that in true marriage the
wife must give as well as take&mdash;give love and
forbearance, and help and comfort.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></div>
<p>Jan&#8217;s and Snorro&#8217;s visit was a kind of festival
for Lerwick. Though it was the busy season,
Peter and Suneva kept open house. Never
had Peter been so generous both in friendship
and in business; never had Suneva dressed so
gayly, or set such plenteous feasts. She was
very proud of Margaret&#8217;s position, and paid her
unconsciously a vast respect; but she opened
all her warm heart to little Jan, and every thing
that was hers she determined to give him.</p>
<p>Dr. Balloch, in his quiet way, enjoyed the
visit equally. He went very often to sea in
the yacht with Jan and Snorro, and, in the
happy intercourse with them, the long days
were short ones to him. He saw the full
fruition of his faith and charity, and was satisfied.</p>
<p>Fortunately, after this event Jan was never
very long away at one time. Until the Russian
war he made short cruises in the African seas,
and Snorro had many opportunities of realizing
the joy of liberating the slave, and punishing the
oppressor. In the toil and suffering of the
Crimea, Jan and Snorro bore their part
bravely. Jan had charge of a naval brigade
formed of contingents from the ships of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
allied fleets. No men did a greater variety of
duties or behaved more gallantly than these
blue jackets on shore. They dragged the
heavy guns from their ships, and they fought
in the batteries. They carried the scaling
ladders in assaults. They landed the stores.
They cheerfully worked as common laborers
on that famous road between Balaclava and
Sebastopol, for they knew that on its completion
depended the lives of the brave men
famishing and dying on the heights.</p>
<p>But after many happy, busy years, Jan came
home one day and found only Margaret to
welcome him. His son Jan was commanding
his own vessel in Australian waters; his son
Peter was in the East Indies. His daughters&#8217;
homes were far apart, Margaret, with fast silvering
hair, and the heavy step of advancing
years, longed greatly for the solace and strength
of his constant presence; and Jan confessed
that he was a little weary of the toil, and even
of the glory of his life.</p>
<p>The fact once admitted, the desire for retirement
grew with its discussion. In a little
while Jan and Snorro returned to Shetland for
the evening of their lives. They had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
twenty years away, but Lerwick was very little
changed. The old world had not been invaded
by the new one. Here and there the busy
spirit of the age had left a finger-mark; no
more. The changes were mostly those which
under any circumstances would have come.
Doctor Balloch had finished his work, and gone
to his reward. Peter&#8217;s store was in another
name, but Peter, though a very old man, was
bright and hale, and quite able to take an
almost childlike interest in all Jan&#8217;s plans and
amusements.</p>
<p>At first Jan thought of occupying himself
with building a fine new house; but after he
had been a week in Shetland, his ambitious
project seemed almost ridiculous. He noticed
also that Margaret&#8217;s heart clung to her old home,
the plain little house in which she had suffered,
and enjoyed, and learned so much. So he sat
down contentedly on the hearth from which he
began a life whose troubled dawning had been
succeeded by a day so brilliant, and an evening
so calm.</p>
<p>Snorro, never far away, and never long away,
from his &#8220;dear captain,&#8221; his &#8220;dear Jan,&#8221;
bought the little cottage in which he had once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
lived. There he hung again the pictured Christ,
and there he arranged, in his own way, all the
treasures he had gathered during his roving
life. Snorro&#8217;s house was a wonderful place to
the boys of Lerwick. They entered it with an
almost awful delight. They sat hour after hour,
listening to the kind, brave, good man, in whom
every child found a friend and comforter. His
old mates also dearly loved to spend their evenings
with Snorro, and hear him tell about the
dangers he had passed through, and the deeds
he had done.</p>
<p>How fair! how calm and happy was this
evening of a busy day! Yet in its sweet repose
many a voice from the outside world
reached the tired wayfarers. There were frequent
letters from Jan&#8217;s children, and they
came from all countries, and brought all kinds
of strange news. There were rare visits from
old friends, messages and tokens of remembrance,
and numerous books and papers that
kept for them the echoes of the places they had
left.</p>
<p>Neither did they feel the days long, or grow
weary with inaction. Jan and Snorro, like the
majority of men, whose life-work is finished,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
conceived a late but ardent affection for their
mother earth. They each had gardens and small
hot-houses, and they were always making experiments
with vegetables and flowers. It was
wonderful how much pleasure they got out of
the patches of ground they tried to beautify.
Then the fishing season always renewed their
youth. The boats in which Jan or Snorro
took a place were the lucky boats, and often
both men sat together during the watch, as they
had done long years before, and talked softly in
the exquisite Shetland night of all the good that
had come to them.</p>
<p>For the companionship between these two
souls grew closer and fonder as they drew nearer
to the heavenly horizon. They were more and
more together, they walked the long watches
again, and fought over their battles, and recalled
the hours which had been link after link in
that chain of truest love which had bound their
hearts and lives together.</p>
<p>And Margaret, still beautiful, with hair as
white as snow, and a face as fair and pink as a
pale rose-leaf, sat smiling, and listening, and
knitting beside them; no fears in any of their
hearts to beat away, no strife to heal, the past
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
unsighed for, the future sure, they made a picture
of old age, well won,</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent8'>&#8220;Serene and bright</p>
<p>And lovely as a Shetland night.&#8221;</p>
